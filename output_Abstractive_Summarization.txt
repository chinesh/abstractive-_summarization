(cnn) -- it seems that travelers can't catch a break this winter. this time it'll be the northeast that takes another hit from the barrage of winter storms that has pounded u.s. airline itineraries this season. by 9 p.m. wednesday, more than 4,000 thursday flights had been canceled, according to __flightaware.com,__ as the storm system wreaking havoc in the southeast advanced up the east coast. on wednesday, the world's busiest airport, in atlanta, accounted for the largest share of the day's flight __cancellations,__ with more than 1,600 of the __3,300-plus__ cancellations across the country. about 27,000 flights were scheduled nationwide wednesday, according to __flightaware.__ charlotte douglas international airport in north carolina was the second __most-affected__ airport on wednesday, with nearly __860__ __cancellations.__ mounting cancellations of thursday flights are more evenly __distributed,__ with hundreds in atlanta, philadelphia, washington and new york area airports. travelers seem to have heeded warnings to stay off roads in the south for most of wednesday, but at least one international traveler really needed to get to the airport to take off. austrian businessman roland __dimai's__ wedding to __vlada__ __golovina__ is scheduled for this weekend in his hometown. but he almost didn't make it after traveling to atlanta for a conference last week. after a __rebooking__ and a __cancellation,__ united airlines put __dimai__ on one of the few delta air lines flights leaving atlanta on wednesday, which arrived in sunny and clear detroit in the afternoon. now he can make his connecting flight to frankfurt and get to the wedding on time. "i finally think i've found the right woman and i thought it's possible the wedding will not happen," said __dimai,__ laughing as he called cnn just after landing in detroit. "i've been scared and sad and slightly hopeful to get it done." 8 tips to ease winter travel woes . __dimai__ was one of the lucky ones. atlanta-based delta air lines canceled about 1,700 of its wednesday flights __systemwide,__ and had already canceled about 1,200 delta and delta connection flights set for thursday. "we anticipate a moderate resumption of arrivals beginning __mid-morning__ __(thursday)__ followed by a set of departures in the __2:00__ hour __et,"__ delta spokesman morgan __durrant__ said in a statement. "our plan is to then gradually ramp up atlanta operations to our usual levels through the day thursday and into __friday."__ southwest, which also operates airtran airways, said both airlines have suspended operations in atlanta through 11 a.m. thursday. airlines don't like ice. delta and southwest airlines didn't wait for wednesday's ice storm to move many of their aircraft out of atlanta. they flew airplanes to other airports to keep them out of the path of the storm. winter storms do most of their damage to air travel on the ground, requiring that aircraft be __de-iced__ while runways and __taxiways__ are cleared and treated, all while passengers, luggage and cargo get loaded into an airplane. "everything slows to a crawl as personnel and ground equipment get bogged down in the __slush,"__ wrote commercial pilot patrick smith, who blogs about flight at __askthepilot.com,__ in his latest book. __"planes,__ meanwhile, cannot take off with ice or snow adhering to the wings, and need to sprayed down," wrote smith. it's not the weight of the ice "but the way it __disrupts__ __airflow__ over and around a __wing's__ carefully sculpted __contours.__ "this can take a half hour or more per plane, and to preclude further buildup it needs to be done as close to departure as possible. and with fluid costing upwards of $5 per gallon, airlines dread snowstorms almost as much as strikes, wars and __recessions.__ when you add in handling and storage costs, spraying a single jet can cost tens of thousands of dollars." it's going to get worse before it gets better across the east. the atlanta and charlotte airports expect frozen precipitation to continue through thursday morning, according to __flightaware.__ at least most air travelers heading through atlanta got the message about cancellations and delays before heading to the airport. about 175 passengers spent tuesday night at the airport, said airport spokesman reese __mccranie.__ "those numbers are far less than the storm we had two weeks ago." the stranded passengers were outnumbered by the 280 airport employees who worked overnight. once the storm lets up, it could take days before the airlines can get all crew and aircraft back into position. airline customers should check their flight status with airlines before departing for the airport. many airlines are offering flexible, __no-fee__ changes to travel dates.

(cnn) -- one of the emergency responders at last month's deadly texas fertilizer plant explosion is now charged with possessing materials for a pipe bomb, a court document states. authorities on friday said they are launching a criminal investigation into last month's blast in the town of west, but have not said if the arrest of bryce reed is connected. local sheriff's deputies were called on tuesday to a residence where they found components for a pipe bomb, according to a criminal complaint affidavit. the officers determined that reed had given the materials to the resident of that home last month. among the materials found were a galvanized metal pipe, a __fuse,__ __coils__ of metal ribbon and several bags of chemical __powders,__ the affidavit states. reed, who was arrested early friday, is charged with possession of a destructive device. "at this time authorities will not speculate whether the possession of the unregistered destructive device has any connection to the west fertilizer plant explosion," the u.s. attorney's office for the western district of texas said in a release. if convicted, reed would face up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. reed spoke last month at a memorial for the victims at baylor university. the arrest details came as authorities said they conducting a thorough criminal investigation into the april 17 fire and explosion that killed 14 in the small town of west. "this disaster has severely impacted the community of west, and we want to ensure that no stone goes __unturned__ and that all the facts related to this incident are __uncovered,"__ __dps__ director steven __mccraw__ said. on monday, the state fire marshal's office said it ruled out four potential __causes:__ weather, natural causes, __anhydrous__ __ammonium,__ and ammonium nitrate in a rail car. the fire began in the fertilizer and seed building, but authorities still were trying to figure out the exact spot, the fire marshal's office said monday. the blast happened about 20 minutes after the first report of a fire at the fertilizer facility. it registered on __seismographs__ as a __magnitude-2.1__ earthquake and could be felt 50 miles away. the explosion damaged numerous homes, a nursing home and the town's high school and middle school, all of which were built within a few hundred feet of the plant. west is about 70 miles __south-southwest__ of dallas, . scores of investigators have followed up on scores of leads relating to the explosion. at least 60 investigators have been on site each day and have conducted __411__ interviews in trying to determine how the fire started and what caused the explosion. "the citizens of __mclennan__ county and texas must have confidence that this incident has been looked at from every angle and professionally handled -- they deserve nothing less," __mclennan__ sheriff parnell mcnamara said. west fertilizer co., which operated the facility, had been cited by federal regulators twice since 2006. in 2012, the transportation department's pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration fined west fertilizer __$5,250__ for storing __anhydrous__ ammonia in tanks that lacked the proper warning labels. the agency originally recommended a $10,000 penalty, but it was reduced after the company took corrective action. in 2006, the epa fined it __$2,300__ and told the owners to correct problems that included a failure to file a risk management program plan on time. the texas commission on environmental quality also investigated a complaint about the lingering smell of ammonia around the plant the same year.

the first season of __"serial"__ ended this month, but the story is far from finished. the popular podcast detailed an investigation into the 15-year-old murder of __hae__ min lee, a popular high school senior in baltimore. her ex-boyfriend and __classmate,__ adnan __syed,__ was tried and convicted in 2000. a star witness in the case against syed was fellow __woodlawn__ high school student jay __wilds,__ who stirred debate this week in a __three-part__ interview with the __intercept.__ parts one and two were published monday and tuesday. the final part will publish wednesday. he says he was unfairly portrayed in the __podcast,__ which revisited in-depth the investigation and trial of syed -- a key part of which was centered on __wilds'__ testimony. over the course of the __12-episode__ __podcast,__ reporter sarah koenig pointed to several inconsistencies in __wilds'__ statements to police and testimony on the witness stand. some of what __wilds__ claims in the new interview also contradicts what he told police -- a point he addressed. "they had to chase me around before they could corner me to talk to me, and there came a point where i was just sick of talking to them. and they wouldn't stop interviewing me or questioning me," he said of the police, in part one of the interview. "once the police made it clear that my drug dealing wasn't gonna affect the outcome of what was going on, i became a little bit more __transparent."__ lee and syed were seniors at __woodlawn__ in baltimore county, maryland, in january 1999, when she disappeared. her body was discovered in a city forest three weeks later. __wilds__ told police that he helped syed dig the hole where her body was buried and led police to her missing car. he did not serve time in prison after testifying for the prosecution. in the interview, __wilds__ described seeing lee, dead in the trunk of a car. "there's nothing that's gonna change the fact that this guy drove up in front of my grandmother's house, popped the trunk, and had his dead girlfriend in the trunk. anything that's going to make him innocent doesn't involve me. __hae__ was dead before she got to my house. anything that makes adnan innocent doesn't involve me," he said. __wilds__ originally told police that he saw lee's body in the parking lot of a best buy near the high school. __rabia__ __chaudry,__ a civil rights attorney -- who grew up near syed and tipped the host of __"serial"__ off to the story -- believes __wilds__ is lying. she pointed to several apparent discrepancies on twitter. "i think __jay's__ next move should be a live televised __polygraph,__ preferably administered by __geraldo__ __#freeadnan__ __#serial__ __#themachinewilldie,"__ __chaudry__ wrote. in a piece for the guardian newspaper, she argued there may be enough evidence for the state to pursue a perjury charge. __koenig,__ the host of __"serial,"__ has not yet commented on __wilds'__ interview. he declined to be formally interviewed for her __broadcast.,__ which is a spinoff of the radio program "this american life." the __'serial'__ __podcast:__ by the numbers .

(cnn)the combination is lethal and becoming all too __familiar:__ a long criminal record, easy access to weapons, a __loathing__ of the countries where they were born and deep-seated __anti-semitism.__ so it was with the perpetrators of the paris attacks. now, it appears to fit the description of the man who killed two people in denmark at the weekend. danish police describe him as 22 years of age, born in denmark, with a violent past, connections with gangs and weapons offenses. jens __madsen,__ head of the danish security and intelligence service __(pet),__ said investigators were __"operating__ under a theory" the attack could have been inspired by last month's attacks in paris, which were also aimed at __cartoonists.__ __carsten__ __ellegaard__ __christensen,__ national security reporter at the danish newspaper __jyllands__ __posten,__ told cnn the gunman was on the radar of danish police and pet for __gang-related__ activity but not extremism, according to his security sources. the gunman had recently spent time in jail for a knife attack. "there is a closer nexus between immigrant criminal gangs and violent extremists in denmark than anywhere else," says magnus __ranstorp__ of the swedish national defence college. "this interface makes violent extremists more dangerous as they are able to switch between roles and __skill-sets__ and have easier access to illicit weapons on the underground market." the so-called __"nordic__ biker war" of the 1990s saw gang members in denmark and sweden attack each other with automatic weapons, grenades, and explosive devices. morten storm, a former danish __jihadist,__ moved from being part of a biker gang to islamist extremism to spying for western intelligence. he says that belonging to gangs and extremist groups had made him feel he belonged to a __"band__ of __brothers."__ in 2012, a convicted drug trafficker and gang leader -- known as big a -- traveled to syria to take up arms against the assad regime. his real name was __abderozzak__ __benarabe.__ the subject of a tv documentary last year by __nagieb__ __khaja,__ __benarabe__ returned to copenhagen where he allegedly raised some $75,000 for the cause. he is now in prison after conviction on aggravated assault charges unrelated to terrorism. there is a long history of jihadist activism in denmark, and intelligence officials believe at least 110 __danes,__ both converts to islam and muslims since birth, have traveled to syria and iraq. some estimates put the number as high as __200.__ at least 16 danes have been killed in syria and iraq, according to pet, including 2 women. last year, isis claimed several danish suicide bombers had carried out attacks in iraq, including abu __khattab__ al __denmarki,__ said to have carried out an attack in diyala province, and abu __sa'ad__ al __denmarki,__ who detonated a car bomb close to an iraqi military convoy near mosul. it is believed as many as 70 danish nationals have returned from syria to denmark. within denmark, according to __pet's__ latest assessment, there are "people who sympathize with militant __islamism,__ but have not been in the conflict zone." they may be __"inspired__ by individuals or groups in the conflict zone or elsewhere abroad," a danger heightened by denmark's participation in the international coalition against the islamic state in iraq and syria __(isis).__ recent postings on jihadist forums have singled out denmark as a target. one entitled __"o__ lone wolves, you who reside among the __infidels,__ your turn has come," and posted last month, urged "sons of islam, in europe, america, australia, france, and __denmark"__ to "light fires beneath their feet." __"developments__ in the middle east in general, including in the __israeli/palestinian__ conflict, increase the threat of attack in the west against israeli or jewish targets," pet warned. a number of jihadist __conspiracies__ in denmark have been foiled in recent years, but early in 2013 a man tried to shoot the writer lars __hedegaard,__ a prominent critic of islam, at his home in copenhagen. __hedegaard__ was not injured, but his assailant escaped on foot. among scores of danish jihadists to have traveled overseas in recent years was __mustapha__ __darwich__ ramadan, who had spent time in prison for armed robbery in the 1990s. he eventually traveled to iraq where he joined al qaeda. ramadan took part in the beheading of the american nick berg in 2004 before being killed fighting u.s. forces in __fallujah.__ much more recently, according to flashpoint partners, a group that tracks jihadist activity, a danish national called abu __ikramah__ __al-pakistani__ was killed in anbar province, iraq. he was not the first to make the journey. in august 2013, a group of danes in syria released a video in which they fired at pictures of six danish __"kuffar__ attacking islam" -- among them anders fogh __rasmussen,__ the secretary-general of nato, morten storm, and the cartoonist kurt __westergaard.__ denmark has been the focus of militants' anger since the newspaper __jyllands__ __posten__ published __westergaard's__ cartoon of the prophet mohammed in 2005. in an edition of its online magazine, __inspire,__ al qaeda in the arabian peninsula called for the murder of __westergaard__ -- as well as __carsten__ __luste,__ the editor of the paper when the cartoons were published, and lars __vilks,__ the swedish cartoonist who was attending the free speech forum in copenhagen that was attacked at the weekend. __westergaard__ is under police protection in denmark after a conspiracy to murder him was uncovered in 2008, and a __28-year__ old somali believed to have ties to al-shabaab tried to kill him in 2010. in 2012, three swedish nationals and a tunisian resident of sweden were found guilty of targeting __jyllands__ __posten__ in an al qaeda plot. prosecutors accused the four suspects of planning a gun attack on the newspaper, to be followed by "the __execution"__ of hostages. they had been tracked from sweden and arrested in copenhagen in a joint operation between swedish and danish intelligence. denmark has a large immigrant population from the muslim world -- including palestinians, __turks,__ __somalis,__ __bosnians,__ __moroccans__ and __tunisians.__ while the vast majority have integrated peacefully, a small fraction of "second generation" immigrants -- as in france -- have adopted militant __salafism,__ especially in __odense,__ __aaarhus__ and parts of the capital. in 2010, one counterterrorism expert, michael __taarnby,__ told cnn that out of denmark's population of some 18,000 __somalis,__ there were at least 300 sympathizers of al-shabaab, the jihadist group in somalia that is now an affiliate of al qaeda. "those attracted are usually quite young -- there's the usual issue of a clash of cultures, of being stuck between east africa and scandinavia and not knowing where they __belong,"__ __taarnby__ told cnn. that clash of cultures threatens to shed more blood on the streets of europe's major cities.

washington (cnn) ____ -- first lady michelle obama found herself at the center of an unlikely breast-feeding debate this week when three prominent conservative women criticized her for encouraging the creation of a __"nanny__ state." conservative radio talk show host laura __ingraham__ on tuesday asked rep. michele bachmann, __r-minnesota,__ about an announcement by the internal revenue service that the purchase of breast-feeding equipment would be considered a medical expense. __ingraham__ suggested that the first lady's advocacy of breast-feeding as a way to fight childhood obesity might have been __"coordinated"__ with the irs decision. bachmann, a frequent critic of the obama administration's policies, was quick to point out that the decision falls in line with the "hard __left"__ agenda. "i think this is very consistent with where the hard left is coming from," bachmann said. "for them, government is the answer to every problem. so government got us in this problem, and so they think government is going to get us out of the problem. "i've given birth to five babies and i __breast-fed__ every single one of these babies, and to think that the government has to go out and buy my breast pump for my babies. i mean, you want to talk about the nanny state? i think you just got a new definition of the __nanny."__ at an event in new york on thursday, sarah palin joined the conversation -- although somewhat __lightheartedly.__ "no wonder michelle obama is telling people to __breast-feed__ their babies, because the price of milk is rising so high," palin joked, later warning reporters, "that better not be the takeaway here." the controversy stems from an irs announcement earlier this month that breast pumps and other breast-feeding supplies would qualify for reimbursement as a medical expense under federal tax law. previously, new mothers who set aside __pre-tax__ money in health savings accounts, or who __itemized__ their medical expenses at tax time, were prohibited from filing claims for money spent on breast-feeding equipment. as for the question of whether politics played any role in the irs decision, __spokespeople__ for the irs and the treasury department said the decision was a legal one made by the irs general __counsel's__ office. two days before the irs announcement, obama held a lunch with print reporters to celebrate the first anniversary of her "let's __move"__ campaign to fight childhood obesity. when asked what plans she had for the campaign's second year, the first lady said, __"breast-feeding.__ kids who are __breast-fed__ longer have a lower tendency to be __obese."__ five months earlier, she used nearly identical language in a speech to the congressional black __caucus'__ annual legislative conference. "because it's important to prevent obesity early, we're also working to promote __breast-feeding,__ especially in the black community, where 40% of our babies never get __breast-fed__ at all, even in the first weeks of life," she said in september. "and we know that babies that are __breast-fed__ are less likely to be obese as children." while the extent to which breast-feeding affects obesity is still unknown, some connection between the two is largely accepted. in 2009, the american academy of pediatrics lobbied the irs directly on the matter because of what it says are the __"diverse__ and compelling advantages for infants, mothers, families and society from breast-feeding and use of human milk for infant __feeding."__ more specifically, the academy's 2005 policy statement on breast-feeding found that "some studies suggest decreased rates of ... overweight and __obesity...__ in older children and adults who were __breast-fed,__ compared with individuals who were not __breast-fed."__ a 2007 report on breast-feeding from __tufts-new__ england medical center found that "there is an association between a history of breast-feeding and a reduction in the risk of being overweight or obese in adolescence and adult life," along with a variety of other health benefits. when asked if her problem with the irs decision stemmed from a belief that breast-feeding shouldn't be in the same category as other medical expenses, bachmann's office issued a statement that __refocused__ her criticism on the federal tax code. "the issue americans have with the tax code isn't with one specific tax __deduction,"__ the statement said. "instead of __social-engineering__ through select tax breaks, the government should scrap the current tax code and put all americans on the same playing field." the irs has a fairly broad interpretation of the term "medical __expenses"__ in the federal tax code, including __wigs,__ __acupuncture,__ artificial teeth, __eyeglasses,__ contact __lenses,__ certain home improvements, __lead-based__ paint removal and television equipment for the __hearing-impaired__ as __deductible__ expenses. the cost of the irs announcement is hard to estimate. although the irs provides broad instructions, individual insurance companies set their own guidelines for what is covered under health savings accounts. additionally, only one-third of taxpayers __itemize__ their __deductions,__ and medical expenses need to exceed 7.5% of income in order to qualify for __deduction.__ congress' joint committee on taxation called the announcement a __"regulatory__ decision" and has not prepared any public information on the issue. a 2010 cost analysis of low breast-feeding levels published in the american academy of __pediatrics'__ medical journal pediatrics found that if 90% of u.s. families followed medical recommendations to __breast-feed__ for six months, "the united states would save $13 billion per year and prevent an excess (of) 911 deaths, nearly all of which would be in __infants."__

(cnn) -- __seventy-nine__ years ago this week, as he signed the social security act into law, my grandfather, president franklin d. roosevelt, observed, "the civilization of the past hundred years, with its startling industrial changes, has tended more and more to make life __insecure.__ young people have come to wonder what would be their lot when they came to old age." the first half of that sentiment carries even more weight today than it did then. recent decades have witnessed changes in technology, in the workplace, and in the work force, that would have been difficult to imagine in __1935.__ as our economy continues to recover from the worst economic crisis since the great depression, we're finding it necessary to adapt to a new economy that bears little resemblance to that of previous generations. but as for the latter half of that sentiment, it is astonishing is how untrue it rings today. even without the assurance of walking out the door 40 years down the line with a gold watch and a __pension,__ younger americans today have far less reason to fear living out their final years in abject poverty. the reason, quite simply, is that social security has been one of the most successful programs in our nation's history. according to the census bureau, more than 35% of americans age 65 and older were below the poverty line in 1959. today, that number is below 10%. take into consideration the families who receive social security benefits on account of the premature death of a parent or disability, and in 2012 social security lifted more than 22 million americans out of poverty. i'll admit that contributing to my appreciation of the social security program is that it is one of my grandfather's proudest __legacies.__ the social security act fundamentally transformed america by putting in place a commitment to the most vulnerable members of our __society;__ that commitment has been expanded with the additions of medicare and medicaid and strengthened by the reforms put in place by the affordable care act . i also had the opportunity to work in the social security administration, which has helped bring to light just how __disingenuous__ are the attacks lobbed against the program's long-term __viability.__ despite social __security's__ extraordinary success, and the program's deep popularity with the american people, it has been targeted with lies and distortions by those who would seek to end the program as we know it based on rigid ideology. we have been repeatedly told that the program is __bankrupting__ our country or is __insolvent.__ critics who point to the glut of baby boomers entering retirement seem to forget that their generation has paid into the system since they started working about 50 years ago. their social security benefits have been __earned,__ not handed to them. in truth, as laid out in the __trustees'__ annual report, social security is still projected to be able to pay out full benefits for nearly another two decades. even without any action by lawmakers, the program would still be able to pay out about 75% of scheduled benefits after that point. the american people should be skeptical of republican leaders who suggest that the only way to save the program for future generations is to gut it. in 2006, opposition to president george w. bush's plan to __privatize__ social security was part of the platform that contributed to democrats winning control of the house and senate. in 2016, republicans could nominate a candidate like rand paul, who just last week suggested that we increase the retirement age for social security by five years. social security has afforded millions of americans the opportunity to retire with dignity after a lifetime of hard work. raising the retirement age would severely threaten to take that away from people who've done the best they can day in and day out, but for whom the demands of their job make working into their 70s __unrealistic.__ and it is frightening to think what would have happened to the earliest baby __boomers,__ who reached retirement in the aftermath of the economic crisis, had they been totally subject to the __whims__ of wall street where they may have lost everything. because of my grandfather's polio, he relied on my grandmother who shared with him accounts of the poverty she observed around the country. those stories fortified his resolve to enact a program that would address the extreme hardship of struggling americans. the __paucity__ of such stories in america today should not be misinterpreted as a sign that we no longer need social security but instead taken as proof of the program's success, and evidence of the importance of its continued existence for future generations. join us on facebook.com/cnnopinion.

(cnn) -- when marvel comics executive editor tom __brevoort__ told cnn in december that "something __new"__ would come out of the recent death of the fantastic __four's__ human __torch,__ he wasn't kidding. for starters, they won't even be using the name fantastic four. on wednesday, marvel announced that the team is now going to be called the future foundation, debuting in __"ff"__ no. 1 in march. gone are the traditional blue costumes. the team will now be wearing __white-and-black__ costumes (with three __hexagons__ replacing the trademark number __"4,"__ as __well).__ and then there's the cherry on __top:__ reed "mr. __fantastic"__ richards, sue __"invisible__ woman" richards and ben "the thing" grimm will now be joined by the superstar of the marvel universe, none other than spider-man (also wearing a new __white-and-black__ __costume).__ reaction to the news from comic book fans has run the __gamut.__ here's a __sample:__ . spider-man joining __"ff"__ makes perfect __sense!__ "i think it's a great idea," said bob __bretall__ of the __comicbookpage__ __podcast.__ "the association between __spidey__ and the __ff__ goes all the way back to __'amazing__ __spider-man'__ no. 1 in __1962."__ one of the most memorable examples of this __on-again,__ __off-again__ partnership with the __ff__ involved a very different kind of costume change. in a 1984 issue of "amazing __spider-man,"__ the __webhead__ ended up putting on the iconic original fantastic four costume ... and they got around the problem of his mask by having him wear a brown paper bag on his head. __bretall__ thinks that __spidey__ joining the team makes sense on another __level:__ "given that johnny __(storm,__ the human __torch)__ has long been __spider-man's__ best friend as a __superhero,__ it just feels right for him to step in and round out the roster to __four."__ comic book historian alan __kistler__ __agreed:__ __"spider-man__ is a scientist with a different perspective than mr. fantastic, and he specializes in different fields, so it could be very interesting to see how his own expertise rounds out this new future foundation. and from another angle, it could be interesting to see how __spidey__ feels about essentially replacing a person he considered a friend and what kind of pressure this will place on him." on twitter, __@solidcolt__ put it this way: " __'amazing__ __spider-man'__ is possibly better then it's ever been. and now he's joining __(writer__ __jonathan)__ __hickman's__ __ff__ so that third movie is totally __forgiven."__ too much __spidey?__ "that's enough __spidey!__ you are everywhere __already!"__ wrote __@kodok_biroe__ on twitter. he might be the most recognizable character from marvel comics, and it's not hard to imagine why spider-man is so __ubiquitous.__ he's even a current member of the __avengers.__ there's a lot of buzz around the new __"spider-man"__ film reboot starring andrew __garfield.__ and then there's that broadway musical that made so many headlines before it even officially opened. still, some fans might be left to wonder: why __spider-man?__ why not a new character for the team? __"injecting__ spider-man into the fantastic four will probably boost sales, but it feels like marvel is kind of __pimping__ out the character and spreading him too __thin,"__ sean fallon wrote at __nerdapproved.com.__ __"normally,__ the addition of spider-man to a __'team'__ comic might worry me a bit. __spidey__ is -- along with wolverine -- one of the most __oversaturated__ characters in the marvel __universe,"__ __g4__ tv's comic book guru blair butler said. "but this new version of the fantastic four comes to us from hickman -- one of the most innovative voices working in comics today -- so i'm actually really looking forward to it, white suits and all. and if you've read __hickman's__ other work, the new title and costumes seem to fit his __science-based__ vision of the fantastic four __perfectly."__ yes, about those new costumes ... __ff's__ new costumes are true to its roots . __comicbookpage__ __podcaster__ john mayo is a fan of the team's new __look:__ "the new costumes look great." __kistler,__ who often blogs about superhero fashion, looked at what makes the __ff__ special in his assessment of the __costumes:__ "(the __ff)__ spend their spare time looking for other planets and dimensions to explore rather than patrolling for criminals to stop. so the new __ff__ suits work for me as a compromise between customized nasa flight suits and 'star __trek'__ __uniforms."__ white costumes ... really? (and what about __spidey?)__ "i'm not too thrilled about the move away from traditional blue, but i'm sure ill get over it," __bretall__ said. "the new costumes are sleek, if not __colorful."__ and even though __kistler__ liked the __ff__ costumes, he is not as thrilled about __spider-man's__ look. "it's __off-putting__ at first. spider-man has such a unique costume design, with interesting line work and shape, and now most of that's been removed. black and white works for the rest of the __ff,__ because it's supposed to symbolize their stark look on reality following the human __torch's__ death, but __spidey's__ faced personal death and tragedy many times and has maintained a colorful sense of humor and the belief that eventually things will get better," he said. "on the other hand, it would be boring to have him wear his classic costume and just add the __hexagons__ to his shirt, so i can accept this as his __ff__ outfit that he wears when he's representing their interests. if he were wearing this in his own comics as well, i'd have a bigger problem with it." is this really a permanent change? as __kistler__ noted not too long ago on __newsarama.com,__ the __ff__ have had a lot of costume changes over the years, though this one may be the most __drastic.__ there have also been a number of changes with the fantastic four over the years, particularly the __"heroes__ __reborn"__ storyline in the '90s. which begs the question, how long will these changes last? "while i am sure i'll continue to enjoy the title as it becomes 'the future __foundation'__ for the next year, i fully expect that a year from now, the big news around the title will be that it is __reverting__ to fantastic four just in time for issue no. __600,"__ speculated __mayo.__ "moreover, there is a strong possibility that issue will feature the heroic return of the human __torch."__ permanent or not, it will be interesting to see whether these radical changes will ultimately be accepted. __brevoort__ promises a __"unique,__ powerful new series that's going to surprise a lot of fans with its combination of mind-blowing ideas and __visuals."__ if it lives up to that promise, you'll be sure to hear __exclamations__ of __"excelsior!"__ from readers.

washington (cnn) -- the convenience store near my house is where i first became aware of the problem. there, an overweight girl, maybe 10 years old, had just persuaded her mother to buy her potato chips and a __slurpee.__ it was __11:15__ at night. from that moment forward, i saw overweight and obese kids __everywhere:__ at church, in wal-mart, at the movies. everywhere. it wasn't always this way. in fact, obesity rates for kids have tripled over the last three decades, according to a widely circulated report that appeared in the academic pediatrics journal late last summer. moreover, the robert wood johnson foundation and nonpartisan government surveys say that one out of every three children in america is overweight or obese. think about that: one in three. (the centers for disease control and prevention uses body mass index -- a formula that considers height, weight, age and gender -- to determine if a child is overweight or obese. click here for an interactive calculator to see if your child falls into either __category.)__ studies find that overweight and obese kids are more likely to grow up to be overweight and obese adults. saddled with heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure and myriad other preventable health problems, they will be sicker and may die earlier than the generation before them. consider this: last november, a report based on the research of dr. ken __thorpe,__ a noted emory university health care economist, found that 43 percent of all adults in america would be obese -- not overweight, but obese -- by 2018 if current trends continue. it was 15 percent in 1980. this epidemic not only threatens the well-being of our children but strains an __overburdened__ health care system, __hampers__ the productivity of our workforce and indirectly undermines our competitiveness as the world's leading economic power. fortunately, there is reason to hope. first lady michelle obama is stepping in to lead a new initiative. having gotten her daughters settled into school and life in washington, the __harvard-educated__ lawyer is kicking off a program to bring attention to the childhood obesity epidemic. in terms of need and potential impact, i would argue that this is the most meaningful public service effort taken on by a first lady since nancy reagan's "just say __no"__ campaign of the 1980s. perhaps learning from early missteps of her husband's administration, mrs. obama is consulting members of congress from both political parties before announcing the national effort. she has solicited their thoughts and ideas to incorporate into the plan. the first lady is using unifying and uplifting language to talk about the epidemic. she has refused to speak about it in abstract terms and does not __disparage__ those who make unhealthy decisions for their kids, like the mom at that convenience store. she uses her own experiences to relate to other parents: . "it wasn't that long ago that i was juggling a full-time job with the round-the-clock role of being a mom. and there were plenty of times when after a long day at work, when the fridge was empty and everyone was hungry, that i just ordered that pizza, because it was easier. or we went to the __drive-through__ for burgers, because it was quick and cheap. and i wasn't always aware of how all the calories and fat in some of the processed foods i was buying were adding up," she said, __previewing__ her initiative in a speech to the nation's mayors last month. on tuesday, the first lady will unveil the details of her comprehensive plan, the broad outline of which, she told a meeting of key members of congress and the cabinet, include four main __elements:__ increasing the number of healthy __schools;__ increasing the amount of physical activity children __receive;__ improving accessibility and affordability of healthy __foods;__ and empowering consumers and families to make healthier food choices. she'll spell out the details in the coming days. the childhood obesity epidemic is the newest front in the battle of the __bulge,__ and mrs. obama should be praised for using her mass appeal to shed light on it. she is right to argue, as she has, that there is no one solution, federal or otherwise. stopping this epidemic will require complementary efforts that bring together government, families, schools, __foundations,__ businesses and others. here's hoping that people across america hear mrs. obama's call to action and join the national campaign to end childhood obesity. our collective future, in no small part, depends on its success. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of anthony __coley.__

(cnn) -- there were nights this season when college basketball was compelling, but more nights when it looked __dysfunctional.__ there were nights that featured the spectacular elijah johnson of kansas going for 39 in an overtime win at iowa state this week, but many other nights that featured a __confounding__ loss of artistry on offense. the game has __wheezed__ and __sputtered__ for three months. it dropped a few __goblets__ of oil from the underside of the carriage with games where teams struggled to score 25 points in a half. i am in the business of watching sports, so perhaps that's why so many people have said to me or sent me an e-mail disappointed at the game they watched the night before. bleacher report: kansas vs. iowa state . great defense and good defensive coaching can make games look ugly and viewers see night after night that defense has jumped ahead of offense in the college game. but now it's march and the college game will fire up a brand new ride for march madness. it will capture the hearts of sporting america as it winds its way through the __exalted__ office tournament pools. but what to do with the old __jalopy?__ it needs more than new wheels and a fresh coat of paint that will come with the new season in november 2013. it needs a real fix. scoring __(points__ per team, per __game)__ could reach a low not seen since the 1952 season. offense is becoming a routine struggle as players cope with physical defense, __tight-fisted__ coaches, technology and the increased size, speed and __athleticism__ of opponents. bleacher report: march madness 2013 . major league baseball lowered the pitching mound five inches following the 1968 season after pitchers dominated the game from their __mountaintops.__ the nba opened up a __spigot__ of offense when it banned __hand-checking__ in 1994 and __forearms__ to the chest of ball handlers facing the basket in 1999. hockey started enforcing its rule book as far as restraining __fouls__ for the __2005-06__ season and scoring went up. there is a solution that would work for college basketball. but, first, a few that won't. unplug technology . big brother is watching. the __video-statistical__ knowledge teams have at their fingerprints has hindered the __best-laid__ plans of many teams this season. ninety percent of teams in division i men's basketball use a service provided by __synergy__ sports that __dissects__ every play, every tendency of an opponent. george mason university coach paul hewitt said technology is invaluable in scouting an __opponents'__ offense and understanding the opposition's __strengths.__ defense has gotten ahead of offense partly because of this advanced __scouting.__ one coach knows the other coach and his favorite plays. teams are not only __dissecting__ opponents, they are creating __dossiers__ of __referees.__ what has been the tendency of a referee the last five games to how he makes __calls?__ well, here it is on the video. referee assignments are made before the season in some conferences, a few days before games in other conferences, so there is plenty of time to scout a zebra before he shows up. officials in basketball influence the game more than any other sport, so knowing who is calling your game or how it will be called is paramount to coaches. play defense without __fouling__ . defenders are loathe to give up a __layup__ not only because it is two points but also because coaches are __screamers__ and __berate__ kids endlessly about defensive __breakdowns.__ it's like a slow roller through the first __baseman's__ legs. what kid wants an __earful__ of __abuse?__ so the defender __fouls__ with a slight push, which means the __dunk__ at the __rim,__ one of the most exciting plays in the game, is rare. players need to be forced by the rules to back up to keep a guy in front of them. let the offensive player shoot the __jumper,__ or risk a foul when you hand check, like the nba. players have to be made to play defense with their feet by the referee. the benefit is coaches might actually stop working on defense 70 percent of the time in practice and work on shooting. if there are going to be more open shots, it makes sense to practice them. it would also help the college player going to the nba where __hand-checking__ is usually not allowed. send the players to the bench . coaches want players to get physical and dare the referee to invite the wrath of the ticket buyer by __whistling__ every chuck and __hand-check.__ if the __refs__ called everything ear __muffs__ would have to be given out at the door and there would be __maddening__ __stop-and-go__ action. well, they need to call everything. stop the bullying and __strip-searching__ of the ball handler once and for all. universal officiating . the ultimate new rule would be to put referees under one system. right now, they are ruled by each conference office, which is a __fiefdom__ that is __loathed__ to __relent__ power. the ncaa could create satellite offices around the country and assign officials to that office. do it like the nba. grade them, kick the worst out at the end of every season. the __refs__ are independent contractors and some of them are lawyers. they might use their day job to protect their night job and sue to work independently. one coach, who did not want to be named because it might invite the wrath of __refs,__ said consistency in officiating around the country would be enhanced if there was a centralized authority. it won't happen. enforce the rule book . good luck. there is one rule book in college basketball, but many interpretations of that rule book. john adams, the ncaa coordinator of officials, started a movement toward freedom of movement five years ago and one of the ways to accomplish that was to ask referees to "call the rule book." that means calling three seconds in the lane to eliminate the shoving for position, __whistling__ post defenders for excessive arm bars to the back, calling __hand-checking__ and blowing the whistle when physical defenders drive __dribblers__ into the sidelines with chest __bumps.__ i had the referee coordinator of a conference tell me that no harm, no foul is fine. no, it's not, says adams. a foul is a __foul.__ reduce the wrestling match in the lane . __hewitt,__ the george mason university coach, said the game is too physical in the paint and the contact has to be reduced. here's a thought: call three seconds on the offensive player. he is not allowed to stand in there four seconds. if there is nobody in there for the defender to wrestle with you have a solution: no __scrum.__ give coaches more time to work with players in the __offseason__ . brian __gregory,__ the coach at georgia tech, said there will be a transformation in the game within two years if the ncaa allowed college basketball coaches to work more individually with players. the __ncaa,__ of course, will tell coaches to quit spending so much time on defense in practice. coaches are going to be told to use their time more __wisely.__ the coaches are getting some blame for the choking of offense. they want to let their teams run and gun, but then they see poor decision making in a fast game, which is followed by a __turnover.__ __turnovers__ do not look good when committed in front of the athletic director, who is the coach's boss. bleacher report: how small ball saved tar __heels'__ season . the fans and media __hiss__ at slow, deliberate play, but when a pass sails out of bounds on the break and the player tries to be the least bit creative, the player is labeled careless and it is back to __walk-it-up__ basketball. now, finally, here's the solution: . the solution is a __24-second__ shot clock . the game will be quicker and more fun. it will eliminate the __walk-it-up__ style and the boring __high-ball__ screen and the same old offense with the current __35-second__ clock. the coaches will have to let go of the reins and allow more freedom of movement for their players. "i have petitioned conference usa for the last three years to let us go to a __24-second__ __clock,"__ said memphis head coach josh __pastner.__ "it would help our entire league in recruiting because we can be the closest thing to the nba. it would be __dynamite."__ more possessions equal a faster game. more offense. i get that. but it is not going to happen. the __have-nots__ think they will be buried by the __kansases,__ __dukes__ and __memphises__ of the world who have more talent. the best we will do is a 30-second clock like the women. it might be that college basketball looks at nielsen ratings where college basketball numbers have stayed the same this year compared to last and figure the game is fine like it is. but, just maybe, more seasons like this last one, where scoring suffered, will convince the caretakers of the game to upgrade offense so the public doesn't have to wait until march for the game to be compelling again. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of ray __glier.__

jerusalem (cnn) -- a letter from about 30 prominent __rabbis'__ wives was causing a stir in israel wednesday because it urges israeli girls not to date arabs. the open letter comes three weeks after the uproar caused by another letter, which was written by 50 __state-appointed__ rabbis and told jews not to rent or sell property to __non-jews.__ the latest __missive,__ which was published by some websites and news outlets, says arab men act polite around jewish girls and "act as if they really care about you," but it says that's a __ruse.__ the men, it says, even change their arab names to hebrew forms like __yossi__ and __ami__ in order to get close to the girls. "this behavior is __temporary,"__ the letter says. "as soon as you are in their hands, in their villages under their control, everything becomes different. you can ask dozens of girls who have been there. they will tell you it is all an act. "as soon as you arrive at the village, your life will never be the same. the attention will be replaced with __curses,__ beatings, and __humiliations.__ even if you want to leave the village it will be much harder. they won't let you, they will chase you, they won't let you come back." it urges jewish girls not to go out with __non-jews__ or work in places that employ __non-jews.__ "your grandmothers never dreamt that their descendants would do something that will take the next generations of her family out of the jewish people," it says. the letter was initiated by the head of __lehava,__ an extreme right-wing group that says it aims to prevent the __"assimilation__ of the jewish people" and works at "saving jewish girls from arab __villages."__ "it's known that girls who go out with arabs are beaten, these girls are in danger. ... there is a violent social trend and everyone ignores it," said the head of the group, __anat__ __gopstein,__ in a radio interview wednesday morning. the head of israel's reform movement, rabbi gilad __kariv,__ harshly condemned the letter and said, __"israeli__ society is falling into a deep, dark pit of racism and __xenophobia,"__ according to spokeswoman __yuli__ __goren.__ more than 30 female rabbis from the reform movement published a __counter-letter__ harshly condemning the one released wednesday, __goren__ said. __kariv__ also called on prime minister benjamin netanyahu and justice minister __yaacov__ __neeman__ to speak out against it. among the __rabbis'__ wives who signed the letter is __nitzchia__ __yossef,__ the daughter-in-law of rabbi __ovadia__ __yosef,__ the spiritual leader of the ultra-orthodox __shas__ political party. esther __lior,__ the wife of extreme right-wing rabbi __dov__ __lior,__ was another __signatory.__ rabbi __yosef__ was one of the authors of the letter written earlier this month that urged jews not to sell or rent property to __non-jews.__ it prompted widespread condemnation from politicians, human rights groups and leading rabbis in both israel and the united states. the letter, which was distributed to synagogues and published in some religious newspapers, had warned that those who defied the religious ruling should be __ostracized.__ it said if one apartment is taken by a __non-jew,__ it __devalues__ all the neighbors' apartments. more than 800 rabbis from around the world signed a petition against the letter, saying __"statements__ like these do great damage to our efforts to encourage people to love and support israel." the petition said "the attempt to root discriminatory policies based on religion or ethnicity in torah is a painful distortion of our tradition. am __yisrael__ (the jewish people) knows the sting of discrimination, and we still bear the scars of hatred. when those who represent the official __rabbinic__ leadership of the state of israel express such positions, we are distressed by this ... desecration of god's name." nearly 1.5 million arab residents live inside israel, making up 23% of the population. a poll published tuesday by the hebrew university in jerusalem showed that 48% of israelis oppose the call to avoid renting or selling property to arabs.

(cnn) -- two journalists in thailand have been released on bail in a controversial defamation case that has raised concerns over press freedom in the country. australian journalist and editor of news website __phuketwan,__ alan __morison__ and his thai colleague __chutima__ __sidasathian,__ appeared in court thursday over a report connecting military personnel to human trafficking. __phuket's__ provincial court ruled that the case should proceed and set the first hearing for may 26. if found guilty, the pair face jail time of up to seven years and a fine of around $3,000 each. the charges, which were brought by the thai navy, relate to an article that __phuketwan,__ a small news website in the province of __phuket,__ published on its website in july last year. the report included information from a reuters investigative piece that alleged some thai security forces, including navy personnel and police, have been profiting from the smuggling of ethnic rohingya people fleeing violence in neighboring myanmar. reuters won a pulitzer prize for its coverage of the plight of the rohingya monday. the royal thai navy filed criminal defamation and computer crimes charge against the __phuketwan__ reporters in december, accusing them of knowingly publishing false information and committing __slander.__ but other thai news organizations that quoted the reuters reporting at the center of the case have not been charged, according to __phuketwan.__ the navy filed a criminal complaint against __reuters,__ but the news agency has also not been charged, a reuters spokesperson said thursday. "to our understanding, the complaint is under review by the authorities," she said. the fact that __phuketwan__ appears to have been singled out for legal action has raised concerns among press freedom advocates that the lawsuit is an attempt to silence the small news site, which has been covering the __rohingya's__ movements in thailand for a number of years. "we're keen to get back to what we were doing and that was reporting the rohingya as an issue," __morison__ told cnn thursday. "what's happened is that we've been diverted by this case to writing about ourselves. so we really haven't been able to cover the rohingya issue the way we were once able to, and that's disappointing, and one of the ramifications of the __foolishness__ of this particular __lawsuit."__ __morison__ and __chutima__ were detained in separate cells at the phuket provincial court for around five hours thursday while officials made arrangements for bail. "we lost our freedom. that is a terrible thing," said __chutima__ after the pair were released. a local advocacy group, the andaman community rights and legal aid center provided the bail of 100,000 baht (around __$3,000)__ for each journalist. the case against __phuketwan__ has been condemned by the united nations and prominent human rights groups, who say that imprisonment is a disproportionate punishment for __defamation.__ human rights watch said the navy should allow authorities to investigate the allegations of trafficking and other mistreatment of rohingya migrants. "the trial of these two journalists is unjustified and constitutes a dark stain on thailand's record for respecting media freedom," brad adams, asia director for human rights watch said in an emailed statement thursday. "the thai navy should have debated these journalists publicly if they had concerns with the story rather than insisting on their prosecution under the draconian computer crimes act and criminal libel __statutes,"__ adams said. __morison,__ 66, who is originally from melbourne, has been in phuket for 11 years where he produces __phuketwan__ and also __freelances__ for international media, including cnn, the sydney morning herald and the south china morning post. he worked for cnn as cnn.com asia deputy editor from 2001 to 2002. __chutima,__ 33, has worked as a __fixer__ for several international media organizations whose staff have traveled to phuket and nearby regions to cover the rohingya issue, including reuters. "these two journalists have done more than most to report accurately from thailand the plight of __rohingyas.__ they have also rendered invaluable assistance to journalists at thomson reuters and other local and foreign media organizations attempting to report this humanitarian crisis," the foreign correspondents' club of thailand said in a statement. "the legal action also seriously damages the image of thailand and claims it may make to supporting freedom of speech and fair comment." thailand ranks __130th__ out of 180 countries in the latest reporters without borders press freedom index. benjamin __ismaÃÂ¯l,__ the head of the __organisation's__ asia-pacific desk described the case as __"absurd."__ "if the navy want to dispute the reuters special report, which has just won a pulitzer prize, it can publicly give its version of events and demand the right of __reply,"__ he said. __phuketwan__ congratulated reuters for their recent award but has been disappointed by the company's response to the defamation case. a reuters spokesperson said thursday that __chutima__ was employed "in a very limited role to help make __appointments,"__ and she was not a part of the team who reported and investigated the stories that were awarded the pulitzer prize in international reporting. "we oppose the use of criminal laws to sanction the press -- large or small, local or international -- for publication on matters of public interest, like the __rohingya,"__ the spokesperson said. the thai navy has denied any involvement in people smuggling. a navy official, who asked not to be named, told cnn in december that the navy did not intend to obstruct or threaten any media, but they were seeking to protect the organization from false allegations. the navy could not be reached for comment for this story. __morison__ is still hopeful that the thai government will intervene and the case will be dropped before may 26 when he and __chutima__ are due to appear in court again. "it all comes down to what constitutes democracy," he said. "the media is a very important part of most __democracies,__ and the military shouldn't be able to sue the media over this kind of issue." __boatloads__ of rohingya fleeing ethnic and religious violence in myanmar have arrived in thailand in recent years. reports of rohingya ending up in camps where they are held at ransom, beaten, killed or sold as laborers have been documented by ngos and media organizations. the thai government says it is committed to combating human trafficking but denies that the rohingya are victims of trafficking. it says that they are migrants who consent to being __smuggled.__

"we think that if you look at how pictures work today in the world and on the web, we're really still tied to the legacy of __print,"__ said __lytro__ ceo jason __rosenthal.__ "this will really replace digital in the way that digital has replaced film." better than its predecessor . __lytro__ was founded by stanford graduate student __ren__ __ng,__ the brains behind turning __light-field__ technology into a commercial product. after raising $50 million in funding, __lytro__ released its first product, a camera for consumers, in 2011. its first __lytro__ was __much-hyped__ but pricey at __$399.__ while the company has been hesitant to share exact sales numbers, the lack of __lytro__ "living __images"__ filling up your social media feeds or websites indicates the camera didn't quite take off. it was seen as a cool gadget with one clever trick up its __sleeve,__ and was alternately praised as groundbreaking and dismissed as a __gimmick.__ the first __lytro__ camera also suffered from __low-quality__ images, a subject the __lytro__ team eluded by insisting that __lytro__ photos cannot be measured in mere __megapixels.__ the __lytro__ format is an entirely new type of photograph that is measured in __megarays.__ the original __lytro__ took __11-megaray__ photos and the __illum__ takes __40-megaray__ shots. having four times the amount of __megarays__ sounds cool, but what does it actually look like? __rosenthal__ says that if you were to export a __lytro__ __illum__ image into a traditional flat photo, it would be the equivalent of 4 to 6 __megapixels.__ it's better, but still a long way from __dslr__ quality. the company says its new camera is "professional __grade"__ and should appeal to full-time photographers and artists. it begins shipping in july but is available for __preorders__ immediately. the design of the __illum__ includes a tilted 4-inch touchscreen inspired by the way smartphone photographers hold their phones and the old __hasselblad__ __viewfinders,__ where you look down. the thick lens has a __30-250mm__ zoom range with a consistent __f/2.0__ __aperture.__ while composing a shot, you can hit a button on top of the camera to play with depth and focus in real time on the __touchscreen.__ there's a color __overlay__ that shows you what parts of the scene can be brought into focus later. the guts of the camera are far more powerful than the original __lytro.__ the operating system is built on android with a speedy qualcomm __snapdragon__ processor inside. it has wireless capabilities, and the __1-inch__ optical format sensor is four times larger than the first __lytro__ __sensor.__ a bold strategy . one hurdle still facing the company is that the __light-field__ image format isn't widely supported and the images are best hosted on __lytro's__ site and viewed in custom __lytro__ mobile and desktop apps. some social networks such as twitter, google+ and pinterest have added special support for __lytro__ images. facebook shows them, but the __originals__ are hosted on __lytro's__ site. gunning for the __semiprofessional__ market is an interesting strategy for __lytro,__ whose original camera occupied a dying gray area in the photography industry alongside the amateur __point-and-shoot.__ it wasn't a professional camera, and it wasn't packed inside a smartphone. many thought a partnership with a smartphone or camera company would have been an ideal solution for __lytro.__ in the beginning, __ng__ did try to license the technology to the big optics companies, but he didn't have any luck. so he decided to make his own hardware instead. __"transformational__ tech needs a transformative product to bring the full benefits," said __ng,__ who is now __lytro's__ executive chairman. __rosenthal__ also dismisses the idea of just licensing the __light-field__ technology. he believes that's like saying tesla in its early days was just going to be an electric battery and engine company. instead, __lytro__ insists on being a __consumer-focused__ hardware __startup.__ this may prove a challenge in __software-driven__ silicon valley, where billion-dollar companies are built relatively cheaply on lines of code. but with a $40 million injection of new funding, an entirely new product for a different audience and a renewed push to make a different photo format catch on, __lytro__ is confident in its technology and ready to try again.

(cnn) -- sitting at her home in west seattle, washington, amanda knox's aunt janet huff was watching the live television news coverage that her niece had been convicted of murder. "it was terrible, it was gut-wrenching just to hear them say it," huff said of the verdict. she had been up for more than 11 hours while the jury __deliberated,__ anxiously awaiting word. she remained hopeful but deeply afraid. she couldn't eat. when the verdict was announced at about midnight in perugia, italy, her worst fears came true. knox and her italian former boyfriend, raffaele sollecito, were convicted of murdering knox's roommate meredith kercher. knox was sentenced to 26 years and sollecito 25 years in prison. following the verdict, people flooded out of the italian courtroom. when the prosecution emerged, a rush of applause followed. "to see the people outside the courtroom applauding -- that just made me sick, that people can be that callous and cold," huff said. soon after the verdict, knox's parents, curt knox and __edda__ __mellas,__ emerged and swiftly moved through the crowd. watch janet __huff's__ interview with cnn's campbell brown . huff said she spoke to knox's parents shortly after the verdict. "they are, of course, shattered. they are not doing great," huff said. "but we have already started the process of appeals. that's all we can do." for __huff,__ knox is still the strong, __kindhearted__ girl she has always known -- not the cold-blooded killer prosecutors portrayed during the trial. huff said knox was worried about the trial's impact on the family. "i think that's what gets her through, knowing that she's got to be strong," she said. "if she falls apart, then we are really going to lose it. knox's parents: our daughter is no killer . "i know she is terribly disappointed, heartbroken and scared to death, but she's more concerned about her family and how we are." with knox's conviction, huff said the family was moving forward with plans for some relatives to move to italy to be near __knox.__ the cost and physical toll of constantly traveling to italy was weighing on the family, she said. "we've looked at jobs and apartments just in case this happened," she said. "there's no way we are going to leave amanda in italy all alone." knox's case has attracted widespread media attention and prompted salacious articles focusing on her sex life. her name and photo have appeared on the front pages of newspapers all over the world, and now, huff fears, things may get worse. "now that there's a guilty verdict, she's always going to be remembered as 'the convicted killer amanda __knox,'__ and i'm disgusted by that," huff said. maria __cantwell,__ a u.s. senator from knox's home state of washington, issued a statement saying she was __"saddened__ by the __verdict."__ "i have serious questions about the italian justice system and whether __anti-americanism__ tainted this trial," __cantwell__ said. "i will be conveying my concerns to secretary of state hillary __clinton."__ huff said she hopes the appeals process will show what her family has believed all along. "she will be vindicated and she will be found innocent," she said. despite the pain the trial has brought knox's family, huff stressed it is nothing compared to what victim meredith kercher's family has gone through. "they still don't have closure, they may think they are vindicated with the guilty verdict but we know it doesn't bring their daughter back," she said.

__brasilia,__ brazil (cnn) ____ -- a doctor __excommunicated__ by the catholic church for performing an abortion on a 9-year-old rape victim received a standing ovation during a national convention on women's health, according to a local media report. archbishop don jose __cardoso__ __sobrinho__ __excommunicated__ the doctors who performed the child's abortion. the response came during the opening ceremony of an event hosted by brazilian minister of health jose gomes __temporao.__ the newspaper o __povo__ reported that __temporao__ called on the audience to acknowledge the __"brilliant"__ work done by a medical team in the abortion, performed in brazil's northeastern city of __recife.__ the girl was pregnant with twins after being raped, allegedly by her stepfather, police were quoted in media reports as saying. the abuse had gone on since the girl was 6, authorities said. the abortion was performed march 4 during the fourth month of pregnancy, according to media reports . archbishop don jose __cardoso__ __sobrinho__ of __recife__ __excommunicated__ the doctor, the child's mother and the medical team involved in the procedure. however, the stepfather was not __excommunicated,__ with __sobrinho__ telling globo tv that, "a __graver__ act than __(rape)__ is abortion, to eliminate an innocent life." the child was not __excommunicated,__ __sobrinho__ said, because catholic church law says minors are exempt from __excommunication.__ "the church is benevolent when it comes to __minors,"__ he told globo tv. "as for the adults, especially those who approved it, performed this abortion, the __excommunication__ is __applicable."__ "god's law is above human laws," __sobrinho__ said. the case has outraged the brazilian public and fueled a controversy reaching the highest levels of church and state in a nation whose law bans abortion except in cases of rape. __temporao__ recently said doctors must put law before religion. "the question posed is very simple. there is a brazilian law which states that a pregnancy can be interrupted in case of __rape,"__ __temporao__ said. "it is legitimate for the church to have its __dogmas,__ but these __dogmas__ must not be imposed on society as a whole," he added. earlier, a verbal spat ensued between president luiz inacio lula da silva and the archbishop over the church's decision. "as a christian and a catholic, i find it deeply __lamentable__ that a bishop of the catholic church has such a conservative __attitude,"__ lula said on globo tv. "in this case, the medical profession was more right than the church," he said. meanwhile, a vatican cleric told italy's la __stampa__ newspaper that he supports the brazilian __archbishop's__ decision to __excommunicate__ all involved in the abortion except for the child. dr. __olimpio__ __moraes,__ one of the doctors involved in the procedure, said he thanked the archbishop for his __excommunication__ because the controversy sheds light on brazil's restrictive abortion laws. he said women in brazil's countryside are victimized by brazil's ban on abortion. some of the doctors vowed to continue attending church services, despite being __expelled.__ "the fact that i was __excommunicated__ will not keep me from going to mass, __praying,__ __conversing__ with god, and asking him to illuminate me and my colleagues in our medical team to help us take care of people in similar cases," one doctor said. tv globo reported that the child, who is from a town outside __recife,__ has stayed in the city to recover and to escape media coverage. her current condition is not known. a new report by brazil's __ipas,__ a non-governmental organization that works with the health ministry, indicates that more than 1 million women undergo illegal abortions in brazil each year. about 250,000 are treated by doctors for __traumas__ due to botched abortions, said __beatriz__ __jalli,__ an __ipas__ official. studies at a brazilian hospital dedicated to treating female victims of violence, the __perola__ __byington__ in sao paulo, indicated that more than 40 percent of the cases involved children. "this is why the __recife__ case is so important for women in __brazil,"__ __jalli__ said. __jalli__ said the liberated "girl from __ipanema"__ image that many foreigners have of brazilian women is far from reality. "we live in a male __chauvinistic,__ patriarchal society with a very high rate of sexual crimes against women and __minors,"__ she said. "our reproductive rights are constantly __criminalized."__ cnn's helena de __moura__ contributed to this report.

(cnn) -- in light of reports that linked the name __"geronimo"__ with the operation that took down osama bin laden, native americans expressed disappointment thursday and pointed to the sacrifices they have made in the service. "to associate a native warrior with bin laden is not an accurate reflection of history and it undermines the military service of native people," said jefferson __keel,__ president of the national congress of american __indians.__ "it's critical that military leaders and operational standards honor the service of those who protect our freedom." initial press reports said that __"geronimo"__ was used in the raid to refer to bin laden, but a senior administration official later told cnn that it was code for the act of capturing or killing bin laden, not for the man himself. __keel__ said that according to his understanding, the most-wanted __terrorist's__ code name was __"jackpot,"__ and the name of the operation was __"geronimo."__ __geronimo__ was an apache leader in the late 1800s who is revered by many in the southwest as a hero, the __ncai__ said. __harlyn__ __geronimo,__ a descendant of the warrior, was sharply critical of the use of his __great-grandfather's__ name. "whether it was intended only to name the military operation to kill or capture osama bin laden or to give osama bin laden himself the code name __geronimo,__ either was an outrageous insult and mistake," he said. to use the name is "such a subversion of history that it also __defames__ a great human spirit and native american leader," he said. thom wallace, communications director of __ncai,__ said that whatever the reason behind the use of the name __"geronimo"__ and the debate over it, the real conversation was being lost. that conversation, he said, is about the 24,000 american indian active members of the military. a disproportionately high number of native americans serve in the u.s. military, he said. the group pointed out that 61 american indians and alaskan natives have been killed serving in the armed forces in afghanistan and iraq, and __445__ have been injured. "let's be very clear about what is important here: the successful removal of osama bin laden as a threat to the united states honors the sacrifice these native warriors made for the united states and their people," said __keel,__ himself a veteran.

(cnn) -- edwin moses would like it to be known that olympic athletes are made -- painstakingly -- not born. in a remarkable career as a 400 meters __hurdler,__ moses won gold at the 1976 and 1984 olympics, broke four world records and enjoyed one of sport's greatest winning streaks -- going unbeaten for an incredible 122 races. known as __"kermit"__ in high school for his long, __frog-like__ limbs, moses started __hurdling__ when he was substituted in for a relay race. "someone got hurt and the coach said 'who wants to try __hurdles?'"__ he recalls. "i just got up there and started doing it. never had anyone teach me, i just learned by doing it." following his track career, moses formulated an assistance program that allowed athletes to accept funding from __stipends__ and endorsements without losing their eligibility to compete at the olympics. today, moses is a father, chair of the __laureus__ world sports academy, which promotes social change through sport, and a financial consultant for an investment management bank. he is also a motivational speaker who aims to inspire success in a corporate environment. here, he tells route to the top about some of the principles that have underpinned his success, and that can apply to your own career, whether you're chasing olympic gold, or just a promotion. first learn, then innovate ... "i won my first gold medal in __'76.__ i was 20 years old, which is young by today's standards. i was right in the middle of my third year of college, studying physics and engineering, so i had a very good grounding in the mechanics of running. "at morehouse college we had no track, no field, no physical therapist, no massage therapist, nothing. so i basically had to put together an intense training program. "i was very innovative, because i didn't have a lot of resources. i had a room mate who was a principal dancer with the atlanta ballet, so i learned a lot about __stretching,__ precision body movements, things like that." know the competition, know yourself ... "in any competitive environment, whether you're in sales or marketing or whatever it is, you have to know your competition, understand who they are, do intelligent analysis on them and then you have to know yourself -- who you are and what you're capable of doing. "you have to know your external environment, as well. " see also: __haile__ gebrselassie - tips for the top . make time for work and leisure ... "the way i look at it, there is a __'no-compression__ __zone,'__ where you have your family, your personal life, things like your health and well being, a __hobby,__ rest and __relaxation.__ "then there's the __'compression__ __zone.'__ you should be ready, when you go there, for things that can affect your performance, like __commuting,__ stress on the job, electronic __distractions,__ media that people get addicted to, and your internal and external job politics. "you need to carve out enough time to be successful in both areas. you have to __strategize,__ __analyze,__ initiate and follow through." adapt methods to suit your own style ... "i always saw hurdles as a form of art, because it's very individual. one technique that may produce a world record for one guy could be useless for another guy. you really have to put it all together yourself. "that's what i did." see also: to reach your potential, dare to be different . seek out other innovators ... "i found ways to maintain my performance through working with professionals and doing things that other people weren't doing. __"later__ in my career, i had a great physical therapist who kept me out on the track. we were doing innovative things like ice baths back in the early 80s when everyone else thought it was crazy. "they were the only kind of people that i would even talk to concerning my races, because we were at a completely different level." even when you're winning, stay focused on your program ... "i never thought about (my winning __streak).__ all i knew was that i prepared myself better than everyone else on a daily basis and every race was mine to lose. "i never thought about the competition. i only thought about the seven or eight elements of my training program that i had to check off every day. "my life became measured in __tenths__ of seconds. i knew exactly how hard i needed to run to hit those targets. i knew exactly how many i needed to do, to be in a certain condition. i knew exactly what intervals i needed for rest time in between. "i had the whole thing wrapped up very __scientifically.__ for me, it was like a big laboratory out there. "i had to think about a year of workouts and where that would put me on race day." be __driven,__ but be ethical ... "in sports, there are people who, with the assistance of __enablers__ and illegal substances can become better, and i find most of them would be mediocre without them. "my career proves that you can be on top for a long period of time by doing things that come __naturally."__ see also: is good karma good for business? it's all about hard work ... "i started out not a talented person in track and field and just loved the sport and put so much into it that i became one of the best. "in basketball, football, whatever, you're dealing with a group of people who dedicate a lot of time and energy and have a lot of work habits. when things get tough, they're the last people out there. "those are the people that become professional athletes. it's not really about talent or just being born to do it. that professional basketball player probably shoots 500 shots a day every day. every day."

(cnn) -- andy murray's birthday celebrations were brought to an abrupt halt after his plans to compete at the french open were thrown into jeopardy on wednesday. a long-term back injury looks set to sideline the world no. 2, who was forced to retire from his second-round match at the rome masters on the day he turned 26. and with the paris showpiece event set to begin on may 26, murray faces a race against time to prove his fitness. "i'd be very surprised if i was playing in __paris,"__ the british star, who lost in the quarterfinals in madrid last week, told reporters following his match against spain's marcel __granollers.__ "i felt pain today, the same as in madrid. i took a few days off after madrid. i hit yesterday and played some points. but i was still sore today." the pain in the lower left of his back has caused murray discomfort since late 2011 and is the same injury which required a __painkilling__ injection at last year's french open. "we will have to wait and see on __paris,"__ he said. "i'll try to make a decision after the next five days or so. i need some days off for it to hopefully settle down." murray's retirement came as something of a surprise after he had fought back from losing the opening set 6-3 and being down 4-1 in the second to level the match following a __tiebreak.__ but after undergoing on-court treatment with the trainer early in the second set, murray decided to call time on his rome challenge. it is the first time since 2007 that murray has retired during a contest -- that was at the hamburg open where he suffered a wrist injury which ruled him out of the french open and wimbledon. murray, who has never won a clay-court title despite training on the surface as a young teen in spain, reached the quarterfinals at roland garros last year. but the u.s. open and olympic champion now looks unlikely to challenge for the title in the french capital. "(the __back)__ has not been perfect for a long period, i want it to start feeling good again," the scot said. "everyone goes into matches with __niggles,__ but this is very frustrating. "some shots hurt more on clay because the movement is so exaggerated. there is not a lot of power on the ball so you have to generate power and pace yourself. "i don't want to go into details, but i've got a disc problem, it changes week to week. it's been an issue for a while, but i want to make sure it goes away. "i don't want to be playing with it long term, it's not enjoyable at all." elsewhere, french eighth seed jo-wilfried tsonga suffered a shock defeat by __jerzy__ __janowicz,__ going down 6-4 7-6. the __24th-ranked__ pole ripped his shirt off in delight after his best result this year, earning a clash with french ninth seed richard __gasquet.__ in the women's section, defending champion maria sharapova eased to a 6-2 6-2 win over spain's __garbine__ __muguruza.__ former french open winner li na overcame chinese compatriot zheng __jie__ 6-3 6-1 as she bounced back from her first-round defeat in madrid, while there were also victories for samantha __stosur,__ maria kirilenko and home favorite roberta __vinci.__

london (cnn) -- the publisher of rupert murdoch's news of the world has paid singer charlotte church and her family __Â£600,000__ __($952,000)__ to settle a phone-hacking lawsuit, her lawyer said monday. the payment by murdoch's news group newspapers includes __Â£300,000__ in damages, plus legal costs, lawyer mike __brookes__ said -- far more than other hacking victims have been paid. speaking outside the court after the settlement was reached, church said the behavior of tabloid journalists had __"sickened__ and disgusted her," and she did not believe the news international apology in court was __sincere.__ "they are not truly __sorry;__ they are just sorry they got __caught,"__ church said. murdoch's news of the world was closed down last summer over revelations about phone hacking and police bribery by people working for the newspaper. targets of phone hacking included not only celebrities like church but also victims of crime and terrorism, wounded troops and their families, and politicians. police are conducting three investigations into illegal activity by british journalists and private detectives working for them. two parliamentary committees are also probing the scandal, and a separate independent inquiry has been established by prime minister david cameron. cameron himself was drawn into the scandal for having hired a former news of the world editor, andy coulson, to be his spokesman after coulson left the paper over the hacking scandal. coulson has since resigned as cameron's spokesman. he denies wrongdoing, but is among more than a dozen people arrested over phone hacking. no one has been charged. the church settlement is much higher than in 59 other suits settled recently by news international, the british newspaper publishing arm of murdoch's news corp. actor jude law was paid __Â£130,000__ __($206,000),__ for example, while retired soccer star paul __gascoigne__ was paid __Â£68,000__ __($108,000).__ the newspaper publisher has also been paying the legal costs of the suits. church had been the lone __holdout__ refusing to __settle,__ but said monday she had changed her mind to protect her parents. news international was prepared to make the case "into an interrogation into my mother's medical history," church said. "i would have learning nothing more from an actual trial since it was clear no one from news international was prepared to take the __stand,"__ she said. __brookes,__ her lawyer, said the settlement was higher than for others because church's parents had also been targeted, starting when she was a teenager. "the news of the world __trespassed__ into the lives of an entire family. james and maria are not remotely in the public eye. they are no more and no less than proud parents with an exceptionally talented daughter," he said. he said in court that news of the world __"targeted__ charlotte and her voice mail messages __repeatedly,"__ obtained her personal medical information starting when she was 16, violated the privacy of her parents' voice mail, and __"coerced"__ church's mother into giving them an interview about maria church's attempted suicide. a lawyer for the publisher said in court he accepted "everything mr. __brookes__ has said," apologized, and said "they should never have had to endure what they have __suffered."__ church's settlement does not end the lawsuits against news international. __cherie__ blair, the wife of former british prime minister tony blair, announced february 22 that she was suing over allegations her voice mail was intercepted to get news of her pregnancy when her husband was in office.

__(cnn)ferguson__ city manager john shaw resigned tuesday in the wake of a scathing justice department report. the report blames ferguson, missouri, police and courts for abusive behavior that disproportionately targets african-american residents. "over the last several months i have done everything in my power to work with countless groups to bring about positive change and strengthen our community," shaw wrote in his resignation letter. he continued: "during this time i have also worked closely with the department of justice to identify opportunities to improve, and then moved quickly to implement its recommendations for change. "and while i certainly respect the work that the doj recently performed in their investigation and report on the city of ferguson, i must state clearly that my office has never instructed the police department to target african americans, nor __falsify__ charges to administer fines, nor heap abuses on the backs of the poor. any __inferences__ of that kind from the report are simply false." __shaw's__ resignation was announced the same day the city council voted 7-0 on a mutual separation agreement with __shaw.__ residents elect city council members, who in turn appoint the city manager. the city manager directs and __supervises__ all city departments, including the police department. along with other officials, shaw was heavily criticized by the justice department report, which found that authorities in ferguson frequently saw residents as __"sources__ of __revenue."__ in fact, the city enjoyed so much success in issuing tickets and fines that ferguson, population __21,000,__ was ranked in the top eight of the 80 municipal courts in st. louis county by having more than $1 million in revenue in 2010, the report said. in one march 2012 email, the captain of the patrol division reported to shaw that court collections the previous month reached __$235,000__ -- the first month collections exceeded __$200,000.__ the city manager reported the email to the city council, congratulating police and court staff on their "great work," the report said. when ferguson court revenues exceeded $2 million for the whole of 2012, the city manager responded to the police chief in an internal __email:__ __"awesome!__ __thanks!"__ according to the federal report. the __doj's__ probe came after public outcry over the death of unarmed black teenager michael brown, who was shot by ferguson police officer darren wilson in august. wilson, who was not indicted on any charges, has resigned from the police department. but when ferguson resident sue schmidt defended wilson at tuesday's city council meeting, she heard vocal objections from those in the crowd.

(cnn) -- __"raed,__ a 10-year-old syrian __refugee,__ is scared. the lightning and storms outside remind him of the sounds of bombs he heard when he was back in syria." -- world vision report . __raed's__ school was bombed right after he and his friends had left for the day. soon his house was also destroyed. __raed's__ father, ahmed, hoped that life in syria would improve, but it didn't. he told world vision in a recent report, "every minute in syria posed a threat to the lives of my family. massacres happened in front of our eyes. i had to get them out of there." ahmed led __raed__ and the rest of his family to lebanon where they are now refugees. as recent reports out of syria __confirm,__ other families have been unable to escape in time. according to world vision responders in the region and now the u.s. state department, armed groups on both sides of the conflict have forced children __raed's__ age and younger to work as __combatants,__ __porters,__ __messengers__ and to perform other support tasks. syria is one of many countries where the use of and violations against children in conflict have become __chronic.__ this week the u.s. government released its annual trafficking in persons __(tip)__ report. this thorough report is a shining example of u.s. global leadership in the fight against modern day slavery around the world and in the us. the report is a critical diplomatic tool to engage countries and enable them to improve their own fight against trafficking. it also makes it possible to go beyond words: if a country is in the lowest __tiered__ ranking, sanctions can be applied. a lot of ink and bandwidth will focus on the u.s. tip report this week and what the u.s. and countries around the world are doing -- or are not doing -- in the fight against modern day slavery. yet buried in the tip report, there is one page that is often unnoticed. it is a list of countries found to be using children in their national armies or in __government-supported__ paramilitary groups. the child soldier prevention act __(cspa)__ of 2008 requires the annual tip report to include this list. but this year the list is more tragic than in years past, because the number of countries using child soldiers increased from seven in 2012 to 10 in 2013. this is the first time since the passage of the __cspa__ in 2009 that the number of countries on the list has gone up. the 10 countries are central african republic __(car),__ chad, democratic republic of congo __(drc),__ myanmar, rwanda, somalia, south sudan, sudan, syria, and yemen. of those ten countries, the u.s. government gives military aid to seven of them: chad, __drc,__ rwanda, somalia, south sudan, yemen, and now the syrian opposition. that means u.s. taxpayer dollars are being spent on armies that use children. the __cspa__ says that any country receiving u.s. military aid and found to be using children in its armed forces will lose key forms of that aid, except that which can help countries __demobilize__ and transition children out of their national __armies.__ over the past three years, president obama has issued waivers or partial waivers to all countries that receive u.s. military aid. the intent of the law is to use the waiver authority only in extreme circumstances. instead, waivers have become the default reaction of this administration and thus our best tool is being kept unused in the __toolbox.__ when you keep your best tool in the tool box, it gets rusty and __useless.__ these countries need support to help end the widespread use of child soldiers and change takes time. nevertheless, they continue to exploit children in their __militaries,__ and the united states refuses to show the will necessary to enforce the law that took effect just three years ago. if the u.s. government is going to put pressure on countries like russia and china as seen in this year's tip report, why would it not pressure governments using children to fight for them? the united nations has set a deadline of 2016 for all countries to stop recruiting and using children to fight in the military. so far the un has signed action plans to accomplish that goal with each of the violating countries listed in the tip report. however, action plans are just words on paper. if we are going to realize the goal of stopping the use of children as weapons of war, then the u.s. needs to actually use its leadership and the tools we have at our disposal. they've already taken a step with __drc.__ just this week secretary kerry appointed former senator russ __feingold__ as the new special envoy to the great lakes region of africa. senator __feingold__ was an original supporter of the __cspa__ and his engagement in the region will mean a great deal for the work in rwanda and __drc.__ now it's time for the u.s. to be just as strategic with the other countries on the list. in syria, the tip report points out that the syrian army and the opposition are using children as fighters, __porters,__ and even __executioners.__ what's more, there are now nearly six million refugee and internally displaced people from syria and many of them are children. as a recent report from the child soldier initiative points out, the likelihood a child will be forcibly recruited to fight in an armed group increases dramatically if that child is a refugee or internally displaced. it's a likelihood that's all too real for __raed__ and thousands of children just like him. the u.s. continues to show its leadership in fighting human trafficking when it comes to sexual and labor exploitation. it's time for the u.s. government to do the same thing for children used as weapons of war. join us on facebook/cnnopinion. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of jesse __eaves.__

madrid, spain (cnn) -- a car bomb exploded thursday in a parking lot at the university of __navarra__ in __pamplona,__ spain, sparking a massive fire, but __"luckily,"__ no one was nearby and there were no deaths, spain's interior minister said.

(cnn) -- q: why are doctors recommending fewer cancer __screenings?__ shouldn't you find out if you have cancer and then decide whether to treat it? "his teeth began to __chatter.__ god __all-mighty!__ he thought, why haven't i realized it all these years. i've gone around with a -- skeleton -- inside me! i won't stand for it." in one of ray __bradbury's__ most famous short stories, "the __skeleton,"__ the lead character goes insane after becoming obsessed with the fact that he has something foreign and frightening inside himself. the story, preposterous as it is, rings psychologically true because it taps into the most primal of all human __terrors:__ having one's body invaded by something different than __oneself,__ especially when that thing is not just different, but dangerous. this evolved fear, which is supported by very specific mechanisms in the brain and nervous system, likely helps explain why people are so much more terrified of cancer than they are of heart disease, even though the average american is more likely to die of the latter than the __former.__ in the case of heart disease, there is only the failure of something we've always had ticking away inside us. on the other hand, cancers are our own cells that quickly become hideous mutant beings, not quite us, but not quite something else either. whatever they are, they invade our bodies to __disfigure__ and destroy us. much has been written recently about why people are so upset over the u.s. preventive services task force recommendation to abandon the current practice of routinely screening healthy men for prostate cancer. some experts have argued that the negative reaction comes from the fact that the panel is just flat-out wrong. the problem with this argument is that copious data suggest that the panel is right. a recent blog on __time.com__ more __insightfully__ suggested that people are loathe to abandon even worthless blood tests because they __anecdotally__ know someone who claims __he/she__ was saved by getting this test at the right moment. prostate cancer __screening's__ false promise . as a psychiatrist i can't help but wonder if the extra fever pitch of outrage over abandoning __prostate-specific__ __antigen,__ or __psa,__ tests might also have its roots in our primal fear of harboring dangerous strangers beneath our skin and our __consequent__ reluctance to give up any light in the darkness that might flush such foreign combatants from the shores of our bodies. to understand the mental health implications of this idea we have to take a step back and ask why abandoning the psa test would improve our society's health. one reason is that, despite its name, the psa is not particularly __specific.__ this means that many people with a positive test will turn out not to have prostate cancer. that's good news for the affected individual, but bad news for overall health and well-being, because this conclusion only comes at the end of a medical work up that includes a biopsy and other procedures that come with their own health risks. here is the more relevant reason for abandoning the __psa:__ it is probably even more dangerous when it is right than when it is wrong. that's because prostate cancer frequently follows one of three courses. sometimes it remains small and contained and doesn't grow. in this situation it poses no health risk. sometimes it grows, but grows so slowly that the person will almost certainly die of old age before succumbing to the cancer. again this situation poses no health risk. sometimes the cancer grows rapidly and is so aggressive that it will kill the person regardless of when it is discovered. in this case the psa test does no material good. what these situations share is the fact that in each case, knowing that you have a cancer growing inside of you doesn't do you a whole lot of good. here is what is being largely ignored in the current __controversy:__ would it cause harm to know you have a cancer growing inside you and do nothing about it? you don't have to be a mental health specialist to suspect the answer to this question is yes, for several reasons. at the most basic level, the knowledge that one harbors an ignored __malignancy__ would place many people in an emotional state reminiscent of the unfortunate main character in ray __bradbury's__ story. they would know that something strange, foreign and dangerous had taken up residence inside themselves, and this knowledge would almost certainly alter how they perceived themselves in multiple ways, subtle and not so __subtle.__ but the real cost would come from the fact that not following up on a positive psa test would almost certainly promote the development of mood and anxiety disorders. why? because we know from many studies that feeling powerless in response to a threat or danger in the environment greatly increases the risk that a person will develop depression and related conditions like post-traumatic stress disorder. knowing you harbor a tumor and aren't able to do anything with this knowledge would be a perfect example of this phenomenon. the cost of this knowledge would be especially high for those already __predisposed__ to mood and anxiety disorders as a result of a tendency to worry, to __ruminate,__ to focus too greatly on their health. but can you imagine any better way to make a previously normal person into a __ruminating__ __wreck?__ imagine living in a world in which every mention of the word __"cancer"__ immediately reminded one of his own situation and his inability to do anything meaningful about it? so from a mental health perspective, it seems to me the guidelines around psa testing are clear: to continue psa testing in __low-risk__ individuals will significantly increase mental health __morbidity__ if treatment guidelines change such that prostate cancers are not routinely removed. but it is also clear that psa testing itself is not the deepest issue at play in the current debate. what it really comes down to is the question of whether we can sufficiently overcome our evolved terror of harboring dangerous foreign invaders inside ourselves to tolerate the clear implication of the task force's __recommendation:__ . for medically healthy men, prostate screening is truly a situation in which ignorance is __bliss.__

berlin (cnn) -- bomb squads in germany successfully defused on sunday two bombs and disposed of an additional __air-dropped__ military device that had caused an evacuation of historic proportions in a city in the country's west. the 45,000 evacuated residents of the city of __koblenz,__ situated on the __rhine__ and __moselle__ rivers, were allowed to return home. workers rendered __inert__ the two bombs, one __4,000-pound__ "air __mine"__ and a smaller __high-density__ explosive bomb. then they destroyed a third __non-explosive__ device by way of a controlled __detonation,__ according to the __koblenz__ fire department. the fire brigade had __pre-warned__ the population about the controlled detonation to allay possible fears that one of the powerful bombs may have exploded. life had come to a standstill in the western german city of __koblenz,__ where 45,000 people -- nearly half of the __cityÃÂ´s__ population -- had been evacuated after the discovery of several dangerous world war ii bombs. "it's the largest german evacuation since the end of the war," fire brigade spokesman ronald __eppelsheim__ said sunday. for 65 years, the __rhine__ river hid two bombs and an __fog-producing__ device that were dropped by american and british warplanes in the last years of the war. when water levels dropped to record lows last week, the bombs were finally found. the function of the __fog-producing__ device was to block the vision of anti-aircraft personnel on the ground during __ww__ ii to make it harder for them to fire upon the allied planes carrying out the bombing mission. "while time passed by, and __koblenz__ was __rebuild(ing),__ the bombs got even more dangerous," __bomb-disposal__ squad member jurgen wagner said sunday. the largest of the explosives is a 1.8 metric ton british air bomb that has the potential to destroy the __cityÃÂ´s__ center, according to the fire __brigade.__ but the focus of attention wasn't on the largest bomb -- it was on the much smaller, __125-kilogram__ __(275-pound)__ american __high-explosive__ bomb. it was __"transformed__ on impact of the earth" making it more difficult to __deactivate__ the __detonator,__ wagner said. last week, hundreds of volunteers started evacuating two hospitals and seven homes for senior citizens. a prison and numerous hotels are also affected by the shutdown. by __mid-sunday__ morning, authorities declared the center of __koblenz__ a __"forbidden__ area." about 1,000 authorities were searching the town to make sure any left behind leave. the fire brigade built a wall of more than 2,500 sandbags since the bombs were found in the river. water pumps draining part of the river help ensure the two __four-men__ teams can defuse the bombs __precisely.__ __eppelsheim__ said he is optimistic the operation will be successful. "people in __koblenz__ are used to bomb __findings,"__ he said. despite the inconvenience for those evacuated, the situation could have been much worse. "if we had found an even larger bomb, we would have been forced to evacuate all 100,000 citizens of __koblenz,"__ __eppelsheim__ said. the __deactivation__ of bombs is a common practice in germany. last year, a bomb exploded in the german town __gottingen__ -- killing three members of a __bomb-disposal__ squad. during world war ii, an estimated __257__ british air bombs were dropped on __koblenz__ alone, according to the local fire __brigade.__ it is not known how many of them did not explode and have been forgotten. __bomb-disposal__ squads have only managed to __deactivate__ three of them until now.

washington (cnn) -- congress' tangled relationship with the affordable care act entered another phase monday, raising a new question about whether lawmakers are really experiencing the exchanges the way other americans do. monday night was the deadline for members of congress and the thousands of people who work on their staffs to sign up for the obamacare exchanges, where they must go to get any __job-related__ health benefits. but with technical problems popping up in the past few days, house administrators gave employees (including elected __members)__ a safety net. if they were blocked by technical problems, staff members will still be able to sign up for another week. hence the question: is that a special break for __congress?__ "i don't think that's anything special," dan __weiser,__ spokesman for the chief administrative officer of the house, told cnn on monday. "our employees face a deadline of midnight tonight, and if through no fault of their own they're unable to sign up, then they're being allowed to follow through on their signing up." now who's having trouble with health care __sign-up?__ ask congress . throughout the day monday, a steady stream of staffers stopped by the house payroll and benefits office to check that their sign-up had in fact been verified. the workers asking questions and those answering them seemed at ease. there were no signs of stress or deadline panic as each worker sat down for the __few-minute__ confirmation process. "this notice confirms your application for __employer-sponsored__ insurance offered by staff us house of representatives was received and __approved,"__ read the short letters given to verified staff members and shown to cnn by several employees monday. cnn spoke with some two dozen workers who were checking their health care __sign-up.__ none would allow their names to be used, saying they did not have authorization to speak to the media. but all of them -- republicans and democrats -- said they felt the potential deadline extension was appropriate. the question of special treatment for congress and obamacare keeps rising like a bad cough, in large part because no other company or individual faces congress' odd combination of requirements and circumstances. gop sen. graham latest to sign up for obamacare, refuse subsidy . the exchanges were designed for small companies, with fewer than 50 workers, and individuals who don't have any employer coverage. congress, on the other hand, employs some 20,000 people. most companies that size negotiate their own employee plans and enrollment windows with health __insurers.__ but because congress wanted to taste the medicine of obamacare __firsthand,__ the affordable care act mandates that the only way members or staff can get health care benefits is by signing up on an exchange. that means they can still buy health insurance off the exchange, but if they do, they will not get the thousands of dollars in premium help that comes as a benefit of their jobs. because of this, congress has an enrollment cutoff date, something that makes it different from the start. outside of congress, there is no enrollment cutoff date. of course, the exchanges do have some __deadlines:__ you must sign up by december 23 to get insurance coverage starting january 1, and by march 1, almost every american must have health care or be __penalized.__ but those deadlines are attached to specific __events;__ there is no time that enrollment closes altogether. obama urges young supporters to talk up obamacare . the department of health and human services confirmed that the exchanges allow people to sign up for health care year-round and that congress is an exception. thus, only congress has both a requirement to go on the exchanges to get employee health benefits and a firm enrollment cutoff date. that __cuttoff__ date was set up by the federal office of personnel management and mirrors the sign-up dates for all federal workers. as problems __bubbled__ up for congressional staffers, last week __opm's__ director gave the senate and house discretion to help individuals who have tried to sign up but were blocked by technical problems. is that special __treatment?__ cnn asked experts and members from both parties and could not find anyone who thought so. "nobody here felt this was anything special," said __weiser.__ "this is just the right thing to do." gop repeal efforts go silent as obamacare __'suicide'__ plays out .

(cnn) -- the gray wolf population in wyoming has grown enough to be removed from the endangered species list and will stop receiving federal protection next month, the u.s. fish and wildlife service announced friday. the decision means that gray wolf has recovered from near extinction throughout the northern rocky mountains, which includes all of idaho and montana and parts of washington, oregon and utah, officials said. the wolves in wyoming won't be protected under the endangered species act effective september 30, when the packs will be managed by the state, federal officials said. "the return of the wolf to the northern rocky mountains is a major success story, and reflects the remarkable work of states, tribes, and our many partners to bring this iconic species back from the brink of __extinction,"__ fish and wildlife service director dan ashe said in a statement. the northern rockies are home to at least __1,774__ adult wolves and more than 109 breeding __pairs,__ and the population has exceeded recovery goals for 10 consecutive years, officials said. the vast majority of __wyoming's__ gray wolves live in the northwest section of the state, where the animals will be managed by state __wardens__ as __"trophy__ game" year-round, federal officials said. wyoming officials will regulate the timing, methods and numbers of gray wolves taken through regulated __hunting.__ wolves found to be preying on livestock also may be controlled, federal officials said. environmental and wildlife groups took exception to the federal decision, saying the gray wolf hasn't fully recovered.

(cnn) -- ugandan officials have recovered what they've described as an __explosives-laden__ belt or vest in a trash can at a nightclub in a suburb of kampala, the chief of police said tuesday. maj. gen. __kale__ __kayihura,__ the chief of police, said the device -- found monday -- was __impregnated__ with ball __bearings__ and was similar to those found at two sites where blasts killed at least 76 people sunday. the device was found along with a __detonator__ and what looked like a laptop bag, __kayihura__ said. when a journalist asked him whether this meant there was a third attack planned, he said, "it's possible there was." the police chief said that his office was working with international agencies -- but would not specify which ones. he also would not say how many people have been arrested in connection with the attacks and what their nationalities were. earlier, fred __opolot,__ executive director of the uganda media center, said authorities had arrested several people but they have not yet been charged in connection with the attacks. "we are trying to find the culprits of this __atrocity,"__ he said. "i can't say i'm not worried, but it's not a question of __worry,"__ __kayihura__ said tuesday. he said uganda is no stranger to bombings -- "for decades, we have been fighting." the blasts went off sunday at two venues -- a restaurant and a rugby field -- where crowds had gathered to watch the world cup soccer finals. the fatalities included 28 __ugandans,__ one irish citizen, one __indian,__ one american and 11 people who are either ethiopian or __eritrean,__ according to the ugandan government. in washington, state department spokesman p.j. crowley said tuesday the latest information indicates that 76 people were killed in the blasts. ____ he added that five americans who were injured in the attacks were evacuated from uganda over the past 24 hours -- two to south africa and three to kenya. he also said that the united states has diplomatic security agents on the ground in uganda, along with a small number of fbi agents. "i think the fbi is going to send a significant __team...__ that will depart the united states this afternoon for uganda at the request of uganda authorities to assist in the investigation," crowley said. a somali islamist militant movement on monday claimed responsibility for the trio of bombings. "and the best of men have promised and they have __delivered,"__ said an arabic statement issued by al-shabaab's press office and obtained by cnn. __"blessed__ and __exalted__ among men -- __(taking)__ full responsibility. __...we__ wage war against the 6,000 __collaborators;__ they have received their response." the 6,000 figure is an apparent reference to african union peacekeepers in somalia. uganda contributes troops to the peacekeeping effort. "we are behind the attack because we are at war with them," al-shabaab spokesman ali __mohamoud__ rage told reporters at a news conference in mogadishu, somalia. "we had given warning to the __ugandans__ to refrain from their involvement in our country. we spoke to the leaders and we spoke to the people and they never listened to us," rage said. __kayihura__ said he could not say whether al-shabaab's claim of responsibility is legitimate. that will be determined by the ongoing investigation, he said. somali prime minister omar __abdirashid__ __ali-sharmarke__ called on the __"civilized__ world to unite in stopping the mindless terror enterprise of __al-shabaab."__ "we will work with our partners in uganda and the international community in bringing the __cowards__ responsible for this heinous act," the prime minister said in a statement released monday. meanwhile, al qaeda congratulated al-shabaab in a message posted on __pro-jihad__ web __forums.__ "be pleased because all the sincere muslims are with you joining you in your moments of pleasure and __difficulty,"__ read part of the message. the blasts hit within 50 minutes of each other. the first one struck an ethiopian restaurant in a neighborhood dotted with bars and popular among __expatriates.__ two others exploded at the rugby center. ugandan president yoweri museveni declared a week of national mourning for victims of the bombings, beginning tuesday, according to a government statement. all flags on public buildings will be lowered to half-staff during the mourning period, the statement said.

(cnn) -- when the judge's __gavel__ fell, the future had been decided for the two teenagers convicted of rape in steubenville, ohio. trent __mays,__ 17, and __ma'lik__ richmond, 16, will spend at least a year in a juvenile correctional facility, although authorities could decide to keep them in custody until they turn 21. both must undergo treatment and will have to register as sex offenders. for the 16-year-old victim, the next steps aren't so clear. she was raped last summer at a __party;__ witnesses posted images of the assault on social media. the case has garnered national attention and sparked a conversation about rape in america. "my family and i are hopeful that we can put this horrible ordeal behind us," the victim's mother said monday. "we need and deserve to focus on our daughter's future." every two minutes, someone in the united states is sexually assaulted, according to the rape, abuse and incest national network. every survivor responds differently to rape, says jennifer __marsh,__ vice president of victim services for __rainn,__ the nation's largest __anti-sexual-violence__ organization. emotions run the gamut from fear to anger to guilt. "it's such a violent and personal crime," marsh said. "it's not somebody just breaking into your house. it's somebody assaulting the most private part of you. having that be public, especially as a minor, can be __traumatic."__ victims of sexual assault are three times more likely to suffer from depression and six times more likely to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, according to __rainn.__ some try to __self-medicate__ with alcohol or drugs. many have trouble with intimacy and forming trusting relationships. one of the most common issues survivors face is blaming themselves for the assault, marsh says. a lot of that has to do with our __culture:__ marsh says she sees rape cases like the one in steubenville every day that aren't taken seriously. "a lot of times, it gets chalked up to, 'oh, kids will drink, and things will __happen,'__ " she said. "but ... sexual assault is sexual assault. and it doesn't matter if the victim was drinking or using substances. the fact is that something was done to her that she didn't want to be done. and i think that's the conversation we really need to talk about." the victim in the steubenville case has endured hostility from the __attackers'__ supporters. although mainstream media have kept her name private, it's obvious she's well-known in the small ohio community. defense attorneys questioned the victim's character on the stand, asking witnesses about her alcohol consumption that night and what she told them the next morning regarding the assault. they also attempted to bring the victim's past into the trial, but the judge did not allow the line of questioning. the character attacks weren't over after the verdict was read. shortly after the trial concluded, two teenage girls were accused of making threats against the victim on twitter, according to jefferson county sheriff fred __abdalla.__ one of the girls was charged tuesday with one misdemeanor count of aggravated menacing for threatening the victim's life. this kind of personal persecution is a big fear for victims, says __becka__ __meier,__ a licensed professional counselor with the women's center, a large nonprofit crisis center in fort worth, texas. more than half of sexual assaults are not reported to the __police;__ experts estimate that 97% of rapists don't spend a day in jail. "when we have a high-profile case that gets reported and we see the victim be __re-victimized__ ... it makes it all the more difficult for victims to come forward," meier said. __"survivors__ are faced with that difficult decision: am i ready and willing to be in a courtroom and face this and talk through all the details again in such a public __forum?__ it's a lot to __ask."__ meier says a guilty verdict often offers survivors a sense of validation -- that someone, at least, believes them. "does it provide closure for a __victim?__ i've never seen it provide __closure,"__ she said. "it's just a step in the healing process." that process never ends, meier says. photos of an attack that are posted online can make it even more difficult, acting as triggers to bring back painful memories each time they __resurface.__ "as hard as they try to delete or erase those images, five, 10, 15 years down the road, they'll be notified that it's popped up again and in some ways they feel like they're reliving that assault," marsh agreed. how a victim's support network responds can have a big impact on the long-term recovery for that survivor. "the first thing that loved ones should do is believe what the victim has said," marsh said. "although we know it's natural to try to figure out exactly how this happened, we encourage loved ones to avoid using __'why'__ questions, because victims often perceive that as blaming them for what happened." family and friends should also recognize that each victim needs to recover at his or her own pace, she says. they should provide love and support without forcing them to do something that they're not prepared to do yet. survivors can contact rainn through their national sexual assault hotline or go to __online.rainn.org.__ many local crisis centers offer __individual/family__ counseling services and support groups. rape isn't something survivors get over, marsh says. but counseling and a solid support system will help them move on. "although they may never be able to forget that this happened, it doesn't have to define who they are or the choices that they make." cnn's poppy __harlow,__ michael pearson, brian __vitagliano,__ __yon__ __pomrenze,__ matt smith, steve almasy and chelsea j. carter contributed to this report.

(cnn) -- the vatican expressed rare public anger wednesday in blasting the leaking of private papers from the pope's apartment, a scandal that observers say lifts the lid on a secret power struggle going on behind the closed doors of the catholic church. a top roman catholic church official called the theft of the documents "an immoral act of unprecedented __gravity"__ and "despicable abuse of the relationship of trust that exists between benedict xvi and those who turn to him." archbishop angelo __becciu__ made the remarks to the vatican's official newspaper six days after the pope's butler was arrested for leaking the papers. paolo __gabriele,__ 46, was arrested wednesday on accusations of illegal possession of confidential documents, the vatican said in a statement issued three days after the arrest. with the leaks, the pope's very ministry "has come under attack," __becciu__ said. the pope himself referred briefly to the scandal at the end of his regular wednesday audience, his first public remarks on the matter. he criticized reports about the affair as __"entirely__ __gratuitous"__ and presenting "a completely unrealistic image of the holy see." but experts say that exactly the opposite may be the truth, and that the arrest, alongside the firing of the head of the vatican bank a day later, may reveal the battle going on behind the scenes at the vatican. the two events are bad pr for the top hierarchy of the roman catholic church, but they may be more than that, experts say. they could affect who becomes the next pope. the effect of each one is the same: to weaken the authority of pope benedict __xvi's__ second in command. cardinal __tarcisio__ __bertone,__ the vatican secretary of state, is involved in a power struggle with his predecessor, experts say. "the reason for this fight is that the secretary of state will have a strong influence over the next conclave which will choose the next __pope,"__ said __giacomo__ __galeazzi,__ a journalist at the italian daily la __stampa.__ the late john paul ii's secretary of state, cardinal angelo __sodano,__ is trying to sideline __bertone__ and put one of his own __proeteges__ in place before benedict dies, __galeazzi__ said. "the leaks will end when __bertone__ is out as secretary of state," he predicted. he said he expects that __bertone,__ who will be 78 in december, would be replaced at the end of the year, but not by the cardinal __sodano__ wants. __sodano,__ who is now the dean of the college of cardinals, isn't the only one who doesn't like __bertone,__ said the rev. thomas __reese,__ author of "inside the __vatican."__ when he became vatican secretary of state, __bertone__ "did what normally happens. he brought in his team, the people he __likes,__ the people he __trusts,__ and he put them in key positions in the __vatican,"__ reese said. "there are people who had hitched their star to the previous secretary of state who thought by now they would become an archbishop or a __cardinal,__ and they didn't," reese said. "these people are unhappy and don't like __bertone."__ part of the reason for the butler and bank scandals is that the vatican hasn't been run well in decades, reese said. __"clerics__ don't go to harvard business school. __bertone__ is a __theologian.__ he doesn't have an __mba,"__ he said. and benedict is no better, he said. "he is a german professor. he's a person who is into ideas, not a manager, and yet he is running a __1.2-billion__ member organization," reese said. there's a faction within the vatican that wants the next pope to be "a better manger who can get the shop in order," reese said. "a lot of people think that would be an italian, of course," after two popes from outside of italy, john paul ii from poland and benedict from germany, he said. but the undermining of __bertone__ may work against that __faction,__ he said. __"bertone__ is from the vatican and is __italian,"__ reese pointed out. "people may say we need somebody from outside who can come in and knock heads together and make it work." reese isn't taking a position on where the next pope should be from, but he has strong views on what benedict's successor should do: "the place really needs to be __restructured__ and __reorganized.__ it still operates in many ways like a 19th century european court." cnn's hada messia and journalist livia borghese contributed to this report.

"these are __solvable__ __problems,"says__ harvard business school professor __rosabeth__ moss __kanter,__ who wrote about the mid-1990s turnaround of continental airlines in __"confidence:__ how winning streaks and losing streaks begin and end." 11 witty and sage airline __'gunk'__ __retorts__ . "you have to take the right operational and strategic moves. you have to rebuild confidence. but it's by acting very quickly, not by a nice note to customers." troubled companies can be turned around, says __kanter,__ if executives take specific steps to address their problems and move forward. add your own suggestions for how american airlines can keep or earn your business in the comments below. admit what's broken and fix it . there's no doubt that american is having problems with its seats. however, __kanter__ says that's probably just the most obvious problem. "the company needs to admit the facts publicly, put them on the table fully and take responsibility at the very highest levels of the company," she says. and it's probably not just the seats. "this is a quality failure of a massive kind and has to signal other quality problems," she says. "the situation is always worse than you think. there are a lot of other things that have deteriorated that you don't know about. you have to be digging deeper because i bet there have to be other things going on." who still wants to fly __american?__ turn to employees for solutions . any solutions must include pilots, flight attendants and __mechanics,__ says __kanter.__ it's often the front-line employees who really understand what's wrong and can __brainstorm__ the solutions to these problems. it may be too hard to get current management to turn to employees for solutions, when employees are rightly or wrong being blamed for so many of the problems. "these __antagonisms__ have been building for many years," says __kanter.__ "in a __turnaround,__ it's management that has to change because they'll never regain the trust of employees." spend money on the core business . with limited money to spend, "the airline must shift investment away from things that are not directly related to passenger and __(front-line)__ employee experience," says __kanter.__ "if that means some corporate staff need to have smaller departments, so be it. they should immediately shift company resources to people delivering the product and those experiencing it." you need happy front line employees to deliver a good product to your customers, she says. and in the case of an airline, that product needs to be safe. "every day people are deciding whether or not to board that plane and every day they can make different choices. the american board and top management need to take this incredibly seriously." many of you fly american airlines frequently. what would you tell american or any airline to do to keep your business? what basic requirements do you have? what extras would you like, and would you pay for them? if you prefer another domestic or foreign airline, please share specific experiences.
REFERENCE SUMMARY 
american's problems can be fixed if management wants to make changes . the airline must convince passengers that its seats are safe and its planes will arrive on time . employees are the likely source of most solutions to the airline's problems .

(cnn) -- a texas mother of five is expected to be sentenced tuesday after admitting to __gluing__ her 2-year-old daughter to a wall and beating her over __potty__ training. elizabeth __escalona,__ 23, was in a dallas county, texas, court monday as witnesses -- including her mother and the pediatrician who cared for the toddler -- testified in the first day of her sentencing hearing, while prosecutors showed pictures of the little girl's hands and bruised body and forehead. "the entire picture was very shocking," said dr. amy barton, then a child abuse pediatrician at children's medical center of dallas, choking back tears on the stand.

"i saw jocelyn laying in the bed. she was facing the wall and ...," the 42-year-old woman said, before she started crying and turned away. it wasn't clear exactly how long young jocelyn was glued to the wall before she was brought to the dallas hospital. once there, medical authorities noticed severe bruises to her face and head, as well as a severe brain injury that led to her temporarily being in a coma. __escalona__ pleaded guilty on july 12 to a charge of first-degree injury to a child, a crime punishable by anywhere between five years and life in prison. prosecutors are asking __escalona__ be incarcerated for 45 years, so she will not cause any more harm to her children, __denmon__ said. "when these types of crimes occur we have to send a message, not only to the __perpetrator,__ but to the citizens of dallas county as a whole," district attorney craig watkins told cnn. "if you choose to commit these types of crimes, we will ensure that you receive an adequate punishment." prior to this incident, __escalona__ had been investigated by texas child protective services but never arrested or charged, said __denmon.__ the child welfare agency put all of her children in foster care after her toddler daughter was taken to the hospital. all five of them, including __jocelyn,__ are now in the custody of their grandmother, __oefelia__ __escalona.__

__ondo,__ nigeria (cnn) -- in the dark of the early morning, the assembled drug agents __murmur__ a short prayer before setting out on an early morning drugs raid. a agent __torches__ marijuana plants found in the nigerian forests but there could be hundreds more farms. after a few short orders, we set off into the deep __undergrowth__ of southern nigeria's forests on a __tip-off__ that somewhere ahead are hidden farms illegally growing __cannabis.__ "it's dangerous because some of them have machetes and in the deeper forest they have pump action shotguns that they use," explained __gaura__ __shedow,__ nigeria's narcotics commander for __ondo__ state. nigeria's national drug law enforcement agency, or __ndlea,__ are battling to stop drugs illegally __transited__ through the country, from latin america and asia into europe and the u.s., spilling over into the streets of nigeria. as we approach the farm, orders go for out for silence and __torches__ out. the agents spill into an opening in the dense forest, and in the __red-glow__ of the rising sun we can make out the unmistakable leaf of the marijuana plant. __ndlea__ suspects there may be hundreds of farms hidden in the forest - estimating the crop they've found this morning to be about __$6,000.__ despite __ndlea's__ efforts the farmers are nowhere to be seen, but commander __gaura__ remains __practical.__ "the people that stay in these farms are not the big people. the big men stay in the cities -- they don't even come to the __farmlands."__ nigeria is on the frontline in the global war on drugs -- an international gateway for cocaine from latin america and heroin from asia to abusers in europe and the united states. it's not known exactly how much is __transited__ through nigeria but __ndlea__ says last year they seized over 300 tons of __narcotics.__ focusing primarily on the main transit points -- roads, ports and airports - __ndlea__ claim to have convicted over 1,800 traffickers. most of them are __nigerian.__ "we do have a big expatriate community of nigerians in europe and united states," explains __dagmar__ thomas at the u.n. office on drugs and crime in nigeria.

washington (cnn) -- the dalai lama, accepting a human rights prize from a u.s. foundation tuesday, chastised the united states for not fully addressing the economic divide between its poorest and richest citizens. the dalai lama sits with house speaker nancy pelosi at the awards ceremony on tuesday. "huge gap, rich to poor. this is __unhealthy,"__ he said. "you have to think seriously about those __less-privileged__ people. they're also human __beings."__ the "real greatness of america," he said, "is your __ancestors'__ __principles,"__ and he urged the nation to preserve those principles. "when i think of america, i think of the idea -- concept of freedom, liberty, equality. i think these are real human values," he said. the inaugural __lantos__ human rights prize, presented to the 74-year-old dalai lama by house speaker nancy pelosi, honors his commitment to ending global injustice. the dalai lama called the award, from the new __hampshire-based__ __lantos__ foundation for human rights and justice, "a great privilege, especially because it is named after an individual i admired __deeply."__ he was referring to the late rep. tom __lantos,__ d-california, whom the foundation describes as a champion of human rights during his 27 years in congress. __lantos,__ who was the only holocaust survivor in congress, died of cancer in february 2008. his image is on the large medal. before presenting the award, pelosi said people continue to be inspired by the dalai lama's messages of peace and __nonviolence.__ the medal, the california democrat said, contains the words "the rights of one are the rights of all." "the dalai lama is one of the most highly honored __peacemakers__ of our time," she added. tuesday's program focused largely on the work of __lantos,__ who co-founded the congressional human rights caucus about 20 years ago. the name of the caucus has been changed to the tom __lantos__ human rights commission, and part of its mission is to __"promote,__ defend and advocate internationally recognized human rights norms in a nonpartisan manner," according to its web site. the group is a formal entity of congress, said howard berman, d-california, who was at tuesday's event. also at the ceremony was sen. john mccain, r-arizona, who called __lantos__ "an __inspiration."__ "when he died we lost one of the better angels of our national __conscience,"__ mccain said. according to the foundation, created by __lantos'__ daughter, katrina __lantos__ __swett,__ the __lantos__ prize is meant to focus attention on the "often unsung heroes of the human rights movement." the foundation's web site says the prize "will be awarded on an annual basis to the individual or organization that best exemplifies the foundation's mission, namely, to be a vital voice standing up for the values of __decency,__ dignity, freedom and justice in every corner of the world." the dalai lama is visiting washington this week for a conference and to meet with undersecretary for global affairs maria __otero,__ who has just been named as president obama's special coordinator on tibet, state department spokesman ian kelly said monday. the dalai lama won't meet with obama, who instead plans to visit with him after a presidential trip next month to china, kelly said. the dalai lama and tibet are __dicey__ issues in washington, since beijing considers the himalayan province a part of china and accuses the spiritual leader of advocating tibetan independence. the dalai lama -- whose name is __tenzin__ __gyatso__ -- has repeatedly said he seeks autonomy for the region, not independence, and advocates the "middle way" of __nonviolence.__ china has ruled tibet since 1951, a year after sending troops to __"liberate"__ the region from what it said was __serfdom__ under the dalai __lama.__ the dalai lama's __emissaries__ have held sporadic talks with chinese officials. but the talks, encouraged by the united states and other countries, have failed to break the __impasse.__ in a 2007 trip to washington, the dalai lama met with then-president george w. bush, who awarded him the congressional gold medal, the nation's highest civilian honor. asked whether the lack of a meeting between the dalai lama and obama represents a change in u.s. policy toward china or tibet, kelly said, "i wouldn't necessarily read ... anything into the decision beyond what it is." "our position regarding china is clear, that we want to engage china. we think china is an important global player. we also don't try and downplay some of the concerns that we have about china ... in the areas of human rights, religious freedom, and freedom of __expression."__ the dalai lama won a nobel prize for advocating peace, but he has not been allowed to return to tibet since fleeing his homeland in 1959. on thursday and friday, he is scheduled to participate in a conference called __"educating__ world citizens for the 21st century." on saturday he is to spend the morning teaching on "the heart of change: finding wisdom in the modern world," an event organized by the conservancy for tibetan art and culture. he then is slated to return to india before traveling to japan, australia and new zealand.

washington (cnn) -- with more than a dozen lawmakers absent due to travel delays caused by bad weather, the u.s. senate postponed until tuesday a key procedural vote on a politically charged proposal to extend long-term unemployment insurance affecting some 1.3 million americans. senate majority leader harry reid received unanimous approval for a postponement from both parties just before the chamber was scheduled to hold the test vote on the first partisan showdown of the new year on monday evening. backers of the bill to extend long-term unemployment benefits were nearing the 60 votes they need to clear the procedural vote. four republicans said monday they will join the 55 members of the democratic caucus to vote to begin debate on the bill. but that's still one vote shy of the 60 votes needed to overcome a republican filibuster. gop aides and senators differed on whether any other republicans would vote for the measure. the vote is scheduled for tuesday at 10:30 a.m. big moments on capitol hill from here on out should be viewed through the lens of november's midterm elections, especially in the senate, where republicans are aiming to retake control. extending benefits is a political priority for congressional democrats and president barack obama, who is trying to make income equality a centerpiece of his second term. obama reached out to several gop senators to try to persuade them to support the bill. many republicans argue a $6.4 billion extension would hurt the economy and act as a __disincentive__ to job creation. others members of the gop have signaled they might back an extension if the cost is offset elsewhere in the budget. sen. mark kirk of illinois, a republican who often works across the aisle, got a call from obama but missed it because he wasn't in the office. kirk said he wants to help people but insisted congress must find a way to pay for the measure. "i, obviously, have people in my state who would benefit. the better way to go is to not add to the deficit in an irresponsible way," kirk said. sen. susan collins, __r-maine,__ is one of the four republicans who said she would vote to begin debate on the bill. however, she wouldn't rule out blocking it later if cost __offsets__ aren't added. "i want us to get on the bill so we can talk about an offset to pay for it. ultimately, i think we should restructure the unemployment compensation program so it's more closely linked to job training for the long-term unemployed whose jobs probably are not coming back," she said. the other three republicans are dean heller of nevada, a __co-sponsor__ of the bill, lisa murkowski of alaska, and kelly ayotte of new hampshire. democrats see themselves in a win-win position on the test vote. they could build momentum for the bill if republicans back it. they get a political weapon if republicans don't. seventeen senators absent . in remarks just before the vote was to have been held, sen. john cornyn of texas, the no. 2 republican, noted that 17 members were not in the chamber and urged that the proceedings be delayed "so we can have a real __debate"__ and decide how to pay for the extension. republicans and democrats alike were delayed by rough winter weather that plunged the midwest and much of the south into a deep __freeze,__ triggering widespread travel delays. sen. lindsey graham tweeted that his commuter flight to washington returned to south carolina shortly after takeoff due to a possible engine problem and made a safe emergency landing. benefits expired . benefits for the long-term unemployed expired last month after congress opted not to continue a 2008 __recession-era__ law providing nearly a year of payments, __footed__ by u.s. taxpayers, that kicked in when state jobless benefits ran out. democrats insist the program is critical to help americans who are struggling and to maintain the economic recovery. republicans argue that the program -- which the congressional budget office estimates would cost $26 billion to continue for another year -- is costly and is a __disincentive__ to looking for work. the u.s. unemployment rate stood at 7% in november, the most recent labor department statistics show. that means more than 10 million people were out of work, a third of them without a job for at least 27 weeks. obama: extend unemployment insurance . over the weekend, key republicans, including potential 2016 presidential candidate sen. rand paul of kentucky, insisted that an extension must include cuts elsewhere to offset the cost. "i'm opposed to having it without paying for it," paul said on abc's "this week." "i think it's wrong to borrow money from china or simply print up money for it." house speaker john boehner will insist on such __offsets__ before agreeing to an extension, a spokesman for the republican leader said. obama supports passage . during his weekly address over the weekend, president obama underscored that failing to pass an extension could result in a drag on the economy. new year, same old fight over jobless benefits . "it actually slows down the economy for all of us. if folks can't pay their bills or buy the __basics,__ like food and clothes, local businesses take a hit and hire fewer workers," he said. while reid is optimistic about reaching the 60 votes to begin debate, conservative interests are applying heavy pressure and keeping score. the club for growth urged all senators to vote "no" on the proposal and cited the lack of spending __offsets.__ "congress should end the federal unemployment insurance program and return the authority back to the states, which already have programs in place," the group said. __"absent__ this, congress should pay for this extension by cutting spending elsewhere in the budget. after six years, an extension can no longer be called an __'emergency'__ with any credibility. there is plenty of waste in the federal budget from which to find an __offset,"__ it said. cnn's alan silverleib contributed to this report.

(cnn) -- not everyone gets a second chance. billy smith and christopher scott know that all too well. they appreciate it all the more because they have been given such a chance. smith and scott are among the men whose stories are featured in the new book __"tested:__ how twelve wrongly imprisoned men held onto hope," which is due for release october 12. the subjects served anywhere from 18 months to 26 years behind bars for crimes they did not __commit.__ ultimately they were freed -- many of them thanks to dna evidence. the book is the team effort of a mother and daughter, dorothy and peyton __budd.__ dorothy __budd__ is a former child sex crimes prosecutor for the dallas county district attorney's office in texas. but it was ultimately her role as a __deacon__ in an episcopal church that led her to this project, she said. "the role of a __deacon__ is to give voice to the needs of the poor and the __oppressed,"__ said __budd.__ __"prisoners__ -- people whose voices might otherwise not be heard. when i heard a woman at a bible study talking about how she thought these men in dallas who had been exonerated were a powerful voice for justice in the world, i wanted to meet them." although __budd__ had no writing background, her daughter peyton __budd__ did, having been selected for the university of virginia's young writers __workshop.__ with her help, they began interviewing the 12 men who would go on to be featured in __"tested."__ although these men all shared something in common, it turned out each had his own way of __coping.__ "for some of them it was the unconditional love of a family member or __girlfriend,"__ said peyton __budd.__ "for some it was the power of music or faith in god." it took billy smith time to get to that point, though. smith was arrested in 1986 at age 35 and charged with aggravated sexual assault. the girlfriend of the building manager of smith's dallas, __texas-area__ apartment had accused smith of robbing and raping her. a search of smith's belongings revealed no clothing matching the description given by the victim. there was no physical evidence tying him to the crime. both smith and his sister testified he was home when it occurred. still, the eyewitness identification led him to be convicted and sentenced to life in prison. "there was a time when i fell into deep depression and __despair,"__ says smith, 58, about his nearly 20 years behind bars. "i became so __despondent__ i considered suicide, even though i know i didn't do the crime." throughout much of his term, smith admits to giving way to anger and __bitterness.__ however, he eventually came to an important __realization.__ "i was tired of being angry, and i knew if i stayed angry i would have nothing to look forward to or hold __onto,"__ said smith. if you hold on to anger, you can't see what's up ahead." before smith actually achieved his freedom, he found spiritual peace through faith. smith entered prison a practicing christian, but converted to islam while serving time. "i found the discipline that i was looking for," smith said. through having discipline i was able to find __serenity."__ smith was eventually given access to dna testing proving he did not rape the victim. he was released in july 2006 and officially exonerated december 13 of that year. unlike smith, christopher scott did not have the benefit of science in maintaining his freedom, and dna evidence played no role in his name being cleared. he was convicted of capital murder in 1997 and sentenced to life in prison. scott spent the next 12 years of his life behind bars before being exonerated in 2009 after another man confessed to the crime. scott insists that like smith, he refuses to give in to anger when looking back on his experience. "in the growing process, we can't be angry about it," said scott, 39. "we have to keep on moving. i was the one out of a million chance that came through. i kept my sanity and fought hard for my freedom. now i'm free, doing things i thought i'd never do." __"tested"__ also addresses what life after incarceration has been like for these 12 men. some emerged from behind prison walls to find themselves like rip van __winkle__ -- in a world they did not __recognize.__ "i didn't know anything about cell __phones,"__ said smith. "when i saw people talking on them with __headsets__ i thought they were talking to themselves." smith admits he was traumatized when he got of prison and had to learn how to live life as a free man once more. while happy about his freedom, he was scared and confused as well. dallas had changed a great deal in nearly 20 years, and most of his friends were either dead, in prison or had moved away. once again, he pondered suicide. normal, mundane situations for most people became a challenge for smith. "i would ride the bus, and i would be afraid to have a woman accidentally brush up against me, because i know how easy it is to be caught up in a lie," smith said. while faith had saved smith while in prison, love saved him in freedom. "i've got a good life now," said smith. "i met a woman and married her. i'm starting to come alive, and i'm having the kind of life i think was meant for me all along." dorothy __budd__ says her book isn't meant to be an indictment of the u.s. justice system. to the contrary, she calls it a __"great"__ system. however, she adds __"tested"__ sends a message that mistakes can be made, even in a great system. "it's easy to say all criminals say they are innocent so they all must be __lying,"__ dorothy __budd__ said. "these 12 men prove there are people in prison who really are innocent. it begs us as a society to take responsibility for that and look again." it's a thought echoed by smith. "if someone is in prison and they say they are __innocent...believe__ them," smith said. "give them the benefit of the doubt. hear what they have to say and work with the evidence that they have, because someone is telling the truth." scott said he believes the path to vindication lies in more than just outside help. "life is full of __doubters,__ but you have to make those doubters believe you were innocent," scott said. "doing that is just being yourself and fighting for what you believe __in""__ while __"tested"__ is designed to highlight the stories of the exonerated men, peyton __budd__ insists its message is something all readers can take to heart and learn from. "it can help anyone through dark times in their lives, peyton __budd__ says.

(cnn) -- the gray wolf population in wyoming has grown enough to be removed from the endangered species list and will stop receiving federal protection next month, the u.s. fish and wildlife service announced friday. the decision means that gray wolf has recovered from near extinction throughout the northern rocky mountains, which includes all of idaho and montana and parts of washington, oregon and utah, officials said. the wolves in wyoming won't be protected under the endangered species act effective september 30, when the packs will be managed by the state, federal officials said. "the return of the wolf to the northern rocky mountains is a major success story, and reflects the remarkable work of states, tribes, and our many partners to bring this iconic species back from the brink of __extinction,"__ fish and wildlife service director dan ashe said in a statement. the northern rockies are home to at least __1,774__ adult wolves and more than 109 breeding __pairs,__ and the population has exceeded recovery goals for 10 consecutive years, officials said. the vast majority of __wyoming's__ gray wolves live in the northwest section of the state, where the animals will be managed by state __wardens__ as __"trophy__ game" year-round, federal officials said. wyoming officials will regulate the timing, methods and numbers of gray wolves taken through regulated __hunting.__ wolves found to be preying on livestock also may be controlled, federal officials said. environmental and wildlife groups took exception to the federal decision, saying the gray wolf hasn't fully recovered. "today's decision by the fish and wildlife service allows wyoming to return to the days of random wolf killing that led to the __species'__ endangerment in the first place," said sylvia fallon, wildlife conservation director at the natural resources defense council. the environmental group __earthjustice__ said congress last year gave hunters and __trappers__ in montana and idaho the right to kill wolves that had been once protected, __nullifying__ a court victory by the group that would have prevented the __hunts.__ __"wyoming's__ open season on wolves in almost all of the state would allow aerial gunning of wolves and even killing wolf __pups__ in their __den,"__ __earthjustice__ attorney jenny __harbine__ said. __"wyoming__ law also allows unrestricted killing of wolves if they are found to be __'harassing'__ livestock or domestic animals, even if wolves are intentionally __baited__ into the conflict," said __harbine.__ "these policies could drive wolves back into local __extinction."__ last december, wyoming counted __328__ wolves, including 48 packs and 27 breeding __pairs,__ the wyoming game & fish department said. that figure included 224 wolves, 36 packs and 19 breeding pairs outside yellowstone national park, state officials said. in areas of wyoming where wolves are designated as __predatory,__ "no state license is required to take a wolf, and there are no closed seasons or bag __limits,"__ the state agency said. hunters are required to report the kill to game __wardens__ within 10 days and aren't required to present the skull or __pelt,__ though state officials are encouraging them to do so for genetic monitoring. wyoming wildlife chief brian __nesvik__ said, "we are taking a conservative approach to wolf hunting seasons during this time of transition from federal to state management. we need time to assume the important responsibilities of wolf population monitoring, sport harvest management and meeting __wyoming's__ commitments to wolf conservation in our state." wyoming officials must ensure population levels of at least 150 wolves and 15 breeding __pairs,__ and the federal wildlife service will monitor the species in wyoming, montana and idaho for at least five years to ensure the animal's recovery, officials said. the federal agency can put the gray wolf back on the endangered list if necessary, u.s. officials said. "our primary goal, and that of the states, is to ensure that gray wolf populations in the northern rocky mountains remain healthy, giving future generations of americans the chance to hear its __howl__ echo across the area," ashe said. "no one, least of all idaho, montana and wyoming, wants to see wolves back on the endangered species list. but that's what will happen if recovery targets are not __sustained."__ the gray wolf grows to 2.5 feet in height and up to 6 feet in length, weighing between 80 and 100 pounds. its coat varies from black to white, and the animal is noted for its broad __snout,__ round ears, and long, low __howl.__

washington (cnn) ____ -- the bush administration hailed north korea's declaration of its nuclear program as a success for the multilateral diplomacy it engaged in through the six party talks with south korea, china, japan and russia. workers remove fuel rods on the reactor floor at north korea's yongbyon nuclear facility this year. in fact, north korea's confessions of many of its nuclear sins -- and its shutdown of its nuclear reactor at yongbyon -- are the closest the international community has come to curbing north korea's nuclear program. as a result of pyongyang's handover of the __60-page__ declaration document -- and friday's expected destruction of the cooling tower at yongbyon -- president bush ordered some sanctions against north korea lifted and instructed the state department to remove the reclusive communist nation from u.s. lists of enemies and nations that support terrorism. but as important as what the document says is what it doesn't say. there is no mention of how many weapons north korea has or where they are __hidden.__ nor did north korea admit to a suspected uranium enrichment program or what nuclear secrets it may have shared with syria. both issues are reduced in the declaration to __"concerns"__ pyongyang promises to address down the road. bush and secretary of state condoleezza rice have pledged a robust verification process to __double-check__ north korea's claims. and north korea has promised to allow u.s. inspectors access to the yongbyon facility and to interview its nuclear experts. but it is far from clear whether pyongyang will allow the kind of intrusive inspections of its entire nuclear arsenal that the united states will need to get a complete picture of north korea's program. congressional republicans not so sure about pyongyang . the __stiffest__ opposition to the deal is coming from conservative republicans. once considered president bush's strongest allies in confronting north korea's nuclear ambition, they feel that the bush administration has let north korea off the hook, especially when it comes to its enriched uranium program and suspected proliferation to syria. rep. __ileana__ __ros-lehtinen,__ r-florida, the top republican on the foreign affairs committee, expressed __"profound__ __disappointment"__ over bush's announcement that north korea would be coming off the lists of enemies and state sponsors of terrorism. and rep. pete __hoekstra,__ __r-michigan,__ the top republican on the permanent select committee on intelligence, accused president bush of sacrificing its principles for a foreign policy success. "a decision seemingly has been made that it is more important for the white house to reach a legacy agreement than to get to the bottom of north korea's nuclear efforts," __hoekstra__ said. __"lifting__ sanctions and removing north korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism flies in the face of history and rewards its brutal dictator for shallow __gestures."__ rep. ed __royce,__ r-california, called north korea's declaration late and __incomplete,__ alleging that north korea built a nuclear facility for syria, considered a terrorist state by the united states, while the nuclear negotiations were ongoing. that, he said, was proof that pyongyang can't be trusted. "how do you have a meaningful declaration of your nuclear program without saying how many bombs you __have?"__ royce asked. "this is a signal to other __proliferating__ regimes that nuclear weapons will be rewarded without ever having to give them up." democrats, who once criticized bush for not talking directly to north korea about its nuclear program, are cautiously supportive of the deal. howard berman, the democratic chairman of the house foreign affairs committee, called the north's submission of a declaration __"encouraging."__ even former presidential candidate sen. john kerry, d-massachusetts, praised the bush administration, saying __"engaging__ our enemies can pay __dividends."__ but kerry added, __"historians__ will long wonder why this administration did not directly engage north korea before pyongyang gathered enough material for several nuclear weapons, tested a nuclear device and the missiles to deliver them." are we headed down the same road with __iran?__ in his 2002 state of the union address, bush termed iraq, north korea and iran the "axis of evil," saying they were __"arming__ to threaten the peace of the world." fourteen months after delivering that speech -- and after dictator saddam hussein released a __12,000-page__ declaration that it had no weapons of mass destruction -- u.s. forces invaded iraq. but no such program was found, nor were stockpiles of chemical or biological weapons of mass destruction. more than five years into the war, the united states is still battling al qaeda and iraqi insurgents there. six-party talks with north korea began in 2003, after north korea withdrew from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. progress was limited until 2007, when north korea agreed to shut down yongbyon and allow international monitors back into the country for monitoring and __verification.__ progress has been even more limited for the third member of the "axis of evil," iran. the bush administration has joined the other members of the u.n. security council -- britain, france, china and russia, along with germany -- in offering iran a set of political and economic incentives similar to the ones north korea was given in exchange for suspending its uranium enrichment program. but the united states has refused to sit down with iran until that suspension takes place. the u.n. security council has passed three resolutions imposing sanctions against iran, and the united states has worked with some success to isolate iran from the international financial community. but unlike north korea, which is isolated and desperately in need of international aid, iran is rich in oil and a powerful force in the middle east. and it's only getting richer and more immune to sanctions as oil prices __skyrocket.__ and iran seems to be running out the clock and waiting to try its luck with a new u.s. president. sen. barack obama, the presumptive democratic nominee, has pledged to engage iran in direct talks to try to curb its nuclear ambitions. sen. john mccain, the presumptive gop nominee, has taken a much tougher line, refusing to rule out military action to prevent a nuclear-armed iran. with the coming change in the u.s. administration, u.s. officials, diplomats and other iran experts believe that it would be at least eight months to a year before the united states and iran could seriously think about talking. meanwhile, by its own admission, iran continues to perfect its nuclear technology. if the north korean experience can serve as a lesson for the next u.s. president, that lesson may well be that the longer the united states waits to talk to iran, the higher the cost will be to get tehran out of the nuclear business.

"it would be crazy not to make the most of a material, which is renewable and responds to serious environmental threats," __kantonen__ says. __"producing__ concrete and steel takes huge amounts of energy." he also believes that wooden buildings will attribute to a better society where people are more tolerant and open towards each __other:__ .

euphoria reigned in many parts of barcelona and the surrounding region of catalonia on monday, a day after 1.6 million people there cast symbolic votes to __secede__ from spain. but the sentiment for catalan independence was not shared in madrid, where there was __skepticism,__ as spain's justice minister called the straw vote a __"farce"__ without any democratic __validity.__ even after more than 2 million catalans voted on sunday, defying two decisions by spain's highest court that it was illegal to cast a ballot on independence, the two entrenched sides -- the catalan government in spain's second largest city of barcelona and the spanish government in the capital, madrid -- seemed no closer to solving the thorny issue. catalan __secessionists__ have staged massive street demonstrations in recent years, and they picked up more steam in september around scotland's referendum on independence. although scots voted to remain in the united kingdom, many catalans insisted madrid should let them vote, too, as london had done for scotland. but the spanish government insists that the constitution does not permit just one of spain's 17 regions, such as __catalonia,__ to unilaterally __secede.__ none of that mattered on sunday to many in __catalonia,__ in northeast spain, where the regional government, backed by 40,000 volunteers instead of regular election officials, staged the symbolic vote. the result was heavily in favor of independence, but analysts said many who opposed secession simply didn't bother to vote, since it was __non-binding.__ turnout was about __32%,__ far lower than the nearly 70% who voted in __regional,__ __binding,__ parliamentary elections two years ago. catalonia represents about 20% of spain's economy and already has broad __home-rule__ powers, including its own parliament, police force and control over education and health. the region also has a long list of grievances with madrid, including over __taxation.__ the catalan president, __artur__ __mas,__ on sunday called on spanish prime minister mariano rajoy to negotiate a __"definitive"__ referendum. but rajoy said earlier in the weekend that he could only talk within the bounds of the spanish constitution and law. with the two leaders seemingly at __loggerheads,__ some analysts predicted the real talks would be about more home rule for __catalonia,.__ others said the crisis could mean early regional elections in __catalonia,__ where polls indicate that a party even more devoted to secession than the one currently in power would win.

the future of space travel will depend on our ability to make rockets that can be used more than once, says spacex ceo elon __musk.__ and on saturday, he gave a crowd at the south by southwest interactive festival the world's first look at a step in that direction. __musk,__ whose spacex dragon is currently docked on the international space station, showed a packed exhibit hall a __two-day-old__ video of __grasshopper,__ an experimental rocket. if fully realized, the rocket would propel spacecraft out of the earth's atmosphere, then flip around, __sprout__ landing gear and return intact to the launch __pad.__ in the video, a __10-story-high__ __grasshopper__ rocket did just that -- except for the __leaving-the-atmosphere__ part. it blasted off, __hovered,__ and then set itself down at virtually the same spot where it began. the video, with its johnny cash __"ring__ of fire" __soundtrack,__ drew cheers from the crowd. friday wasn't the first time __grasshopper__ has left the ground, but it was the most ambitious test to date, musk said. "with each successive test, we want to go higher and further," he said. __musk,__ a festival keynote speaker, made his fortune as the founder of __paypal.__ from there, he's taken on private spaceflight as ceo of __spacex,__ electric vehicles as ceo and chief designer of tesla motors, and solar energy as chairman of solar city. __"elon__ may be the planet's most exciting __entrepreneur,"__ said sxsw interactive director hugh __forrest.__ historic launch of private rocket __heralds__ new era . during a question-and-answer session with __"3d__ __robotics"__ editor-in-chief chris anderson, musk said that affordable commercial space travel will never be possible with the current model, which relies on __single-use__ booster rockets. "every mode of transportation we're used to ... they're all __reusable,__ but not __rockets,"__ musk said. "if we can't make rockets __reusable,__ the cost is just __prohibitive."__ he said a reusable rocket could make space launches 100 times __cheaper.__ the price of fuel, oxygen and the like for a launch currently amounts to just a fraction of 1% of its overall cost, he said. musk also recounted the stressful moments around last week's launch of the unmanned dragon cargo vessel, which linked up with the space station last sunday. "it's extremely __nerve-wracking,"__ he said. "the thing about a rocket launch is that all your work is __distilled__ into these few minutes, especially the few seconds before __liftoff."__ the dragon mission had some extra __nail-biting__ moments. once in space, three of its four __thruster__ pods __malfunctioned.__ engineers were able to write new code and beam it to the capsule and __"pressure__ __slam"__ oxygen into tanks that had failed to __oxidize.__ "we were sort of trying to give it the spacecraft equivalent of the __heimlich__ __maneuver,"__ he said. "it was __hardcore.__ i don't want to go through that again." musk also confirmed that, while he's in texas, he's meeting with state lawmakers about the possibility of building a commercial launch site in the state. currently, spacex -- which both works alongside nasa and counts the agency among its clients -- launches from cape canaveral in florida and vandenberg air force base in california, which are both government sites. musk said texas is the leading candidate for the launch site and that, if things go smoothly, construction could begin as early as next year.

san diego (cnn) -- the case against florida neighborhood watch volunteer george zimmerman -- which has, for the last several weeks, been __exhaustively__ tried in the court of public opinion -- is now headed where it __belongs:__ to a court of law. special prosecutor angela corey announced wednesday that zimmerman would be charged with second-degree murder in the tragic death of unarmed 17-year-old trayvon martin. the 28-year-old zimmerman, who had been in hiding even from his own attorneys, turned himself in to authorities and is in police custody awaiting a hearing on the charges. for those americans who think that zimmerman acted in self-defense to save his own life, the decision to charge him is tantamount to giving in to a __mob.__ in fact, as i skipped from one conservative talk radio show to another wednesday afternoon, that's how i heard it described by hosts and callers alike. yet, for those who believe that zimmerman was the aggressor in this fateful encounter, that he racially profiled martin and then essentially hunted him down, the decision represents something else: justice. that's how martin's family described it in applauding zimmerman's arrest. personally, i'm thankful the suspect is in custody. and that has nothing to do with which team i'm on -- team martin or team zimmerman. that's irrelevant. but, if you must know, i don't have a team. i don't know that really happened on the night of february 26 on that dark street in sanford, florida. and neither do you. after all, we weren't there. of course, we all have our __biases.__ and some of mine come from being the son of a retired cop who spent 37 years on the job. from that vantage point, i would just as soon people like zimmerman leave the police work to the professionals. and yet, even so, once the struggle began and the two men are wrestling on the ground, if zimmerman felt his life was threatened, i can't condemn his decision to use deadly force to defend himself. i'm only sure of this __much:__ this case had to go to trial. it had to be this way. whether you think zimmerman is innocent or guilty, we all should be able to agree on that much. we couldn't go on otherwise, with one segment of the country believing that someone got away with second-degree murder and the suspect looking over his shoulder for the rest of his life. this case cries out for clarity and resolution, and the only place to get either is in court. we need to be able to see and hear the evidence, and let a jury decide whether zimmerman is guilty as charged or whether he acted in self-defense. whatever the verdict turns out to be, let's hope that both camps are mature enough to accept it. i'm not hopeful. too many people have already made up their minds. in fact, it's hard to see how zimmerman can get a fair trial -- especially in seminole county. the strain is showing. the country hasn't been this racially divided since the o.j. simpson criminal trial in 1995. and as with that trial, how you see these events seems to have a lot to do with the color of your skin. but this time, there's a twist. during the simpson trial, when the defendant was black and the victims were white, polls showed that most whites thought the former football star was guilty, while african-americans urged us to wait for the evidence to come in. in the martin case, the roles are reversed as many african-americans seem quick to convict zimmerman and many whites urge us to wait for the evidence to come in. that's not a good sign. do americans need better laws, or just better __memories?__ the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of ruben navarrette jr.

"this is an example yet again of the president having to put his responsibilities as commander in chief and as leader of the country first while at the same time he pursues his responsibilities as candidate for election," white house spokesman josh earnest said friday. in a statement sunday at the headquarters of the federal emergency management agency, obama warned americans in the storm's path to prepare.

"it gets __tricky,"__ the source __conceded.__ __"optics__ are important." that source said the romney campaign will "play it by __ear"__ as the storm __unfolds.__ romney campaign spokesman kevin madden said sunday afternoon that campaign workers in virginia "are doing as much as they can to help with relief efforts." the former massachusetts governor and the president have already canceled stops in virginia, a pivotal swing state expected to be hard hit. vice president joe biden canceled a saturday event in virginia and one scheduled for monday in new hampshire. both campaigns cited a desire not to use resources better targeted toward __pre-storm__ __preparations.__ __crowley:__ sandy introduces big unknown into campaign . ann romney, who was slated to campaign in new hampshire on monday, canceled her events, and the romney campaign said the bus that was to be used for her visit would instead be deployed for __"relief__ efforts throughout the east __coast."__ both campaigns said they were suspending fundraising e-mails to supporters in virginia, pennsylvania, north carolina, new jersey and the district of columbia. obama canceled trips to the battlegrounds of ohio and colorado to stay in washington and monitor the oncoming storm, though a campaign trip to florida remained on the president's schedule for monday. romney is scheduled to campaign in ohio, iowa and wisconsin on monday, then in ohio on tuesday. a romney campaign stop scheduled for tuesday in new hampshire was canceled late sunday afternoon, the campaign announced in an __e-mai.__ opinion: how sandy will test obama, romney . madden said the campaign would continue to update romney's calendar, based on where the storm goes. "the schedule we have locked down for now are in states that are not directly impacted by the storm," he said. "but, again, we're going to continue to update it. we're going to continue to monitor the situation and stay in close contact with folks that are in the states that have the best information." this is the second time the campaign has been affected by a major weather event. hurricane isaac forced the cancellation of the first day of the republican national convention in tampa, florida, in august. asked whether the romney campaign felt __snake-bitten__ by mother nature, madden said, "well, there's certain things we can't control and nature's one of them. so we just try to have focus on what we can control and part of what we can control is making sure that safety is a priority for the people that are in harm's way in some of these states that are going to be directly impacted and so that's a top concern and it'll remain a top concern." while the political experts navigated the ramifications of the storm, at least one campaign had more practical matters in mind. tim __kaine,__ the democratic senate candidate in virginia, e-mailed supporters to ask them to take their yard signs down during the storm, lest they become __projectiles.__

khartoum, sudan (cnn) -- sudan and southern sudan have signed an agreement on border security amid tensions over the disputed abyei border region, the african union said tuesday. the deal, negotiated monday in addis ababa, ethiopia, is designed to "ensure that the two parties can maintain stable and secure relations," the african union said in a statement. ____ "the agreement also establishes a common border zone between north and south sudan, which is to be demilitarized and jointly monitored and __patrolled."__ the deal was brokered by the african union and signed by top military and political officials. additional negotiations will be held within a week, the statement said. in the wake of january's lopsided vote for independence by residents of southern sudan, the autonomous region has been scheduled to become an independent state in early july. but __ezekiel__ __gatkuoth,__ the representative of southern sudan to the united states, said war could break out between the two sides if the international community does not demand that sudan withdraw its forces from abyei so residents who have fled can return. "people are dying daily. they have no food. they have no __shelter,"__ he said. "we are asking the world to respond to this __catastrophe."__ the world food programme said rains made roads impassable in areas south of __abyei,__ where refugees went, temporarily disrupting food distribution, which had resumed tuesday. rain and impassable roads were also making it harder to find people as they fled into the bush, which has made it tough to get a reliable estimate of the number of the displaced. the sudan people's liberation army has cited __150,000;__ the united nations has cited 30,000 to __40,000.__ last week, the president of the southern sudanese government demanded an immediate withdrawal of the sudanese armed forces that occupy __abyei.__ and on monday, the government of sudan requested that the united nations mission in sudan __(unmis)__ leave the country by july 9, the date set for south sudan's independence. "the sudanese foreign minister has sent a letter to ban ki-moon that __unmis'__ mandate in sudan comes to an end at the end of the transitional period, on july __9,"__ said khalid __musa,__ spokesman for the sudanese ministry of foreign affairs, referring to the u.n. __secretary-general.__ asked whether tensions in abyei could lead to an extension of __unmis'__ mandate in sudan, musa said: "the government is open to dialogue as realities unfold on the ground, but __unmis'__ mandate ends on july __9."__ __unmis__ spokesman __koudeir__ __zerrouk__ confirmed the request. "the government has informed us of its request and a letter was sent to the u.n. __secretary-general,"__ he told cnn. __unmis__ was established following passage of u.n. security council resolution __1590__ to help facilitate __peace-building__ and humanitarian efforts in sudan shortly after the signing of the comprehensive peace agreement. fighting began may 19, when the north accused southern sudanese forces of __ambushing__ a u.n. convoy carrying northern troops to __goli,__ killing at least 22 soldiers. in retaliation, sudanese troops attacked and took control of __abyei,__ a move condemned by the united states as a breach of the 2005 comprehensive peace agreement, which ended the county's __decadeslong__ civil war between the predominantly arab and muslim north and predominantly black __animist__ and christian south. the conflict led to the deaths of two million people, many from starvation. the u.n. compound in abyei was shelled by mortar rounds and two peacekeepers were wounded, according to a statement from u.n. secretary-general ban __ki-moon's__ press office. the sudanese armed forces said the military in southern sudan was behind the may 19 attack, but the sudan people's liberation army denied responsibility. also monday, the sudanese government disputed claims by actor george clooney's satellite sentinel project that government forces were involved in ethnic cleansing by destroying __banton__ bridge -- a key link with southern sudan. ____ pictures posted by the organization show the demolished bridge sitting in a river bed. the government challenged clooney to prove his allegations.

"we'll be ready, but we're planning for __contingencies__ if there's still a problem," bob mcdonnell said on "state of the union." he said his state would "absolutely" make polling centers such as schools and fire stations a top priority for restoring power should widespread outages occur. another __virginian,__ democratic sen. mark warner, predicted on fox news the __"storm__ will throw havoc into the race." obama, romney campaigns cancel events ahead of hurricane . in virginia, the effects of a major storm could linger until election day. hundreds of thousands of customers in northern virginia lost power for more than week after hurricane irene in august 2011 and again in june after a powerful complex of thunderstorms called a __derecho__ moved through. residents' priorities might still be dealing with the storm's aftermath rather than a trip to the polls. virginia offers early absentee voting only with an __excuse,__ unlike other states that offer less restrictive ways to cast ballots before november 6. that means the race in the commonwealth will be won or lost on election day. north carolina and maryland, two other states in the storm's projected path, offer in-person early voting, which has benefited democrats in the past. martin o'malley, maryland's democratic governor, canceled early voting on monday in his state. in delaware, new york, massachusetts, connecticut and rhode island, residents only have the option of voting early by mail. hurricane __sandy:__ 5 things to know . sen. john mccain, r-arizona, predicted sunday the storm could help boost obama in the eyes of voters, but said he doubted the image of a strong leader would sway voters after months of campaigning. "i think that the president of the united states is the commander in __chief,"__ mccain said on cbs. "the american people look to him, and i'm sure he will conduct himself and play his leadership role in a fine fashion. so i would imagine that might help him a little bit. but i'm not sure it will affect votes. ____ people have been exposed to this very long campaign." obama is being briefed regularly on the storm's path, white house officials say, and he will balance his campaign with his responsibilities as president. "this is an example yet again of the president having to put his responsibilities as commander in chief and as leader of the country first while at the same time he pursues his responsibilities as candidate for election," white house spokesman josh earnest said friday. in a statement sunday at the headquarters of the federal emergency management agency, obama warned americans in the storm's path to prepare. "this is a serious and big storm," obama said at __fema,__ adding "you need to take this seriously and take guidance from state and local officials." obama advises preparedness ahead of storm . while obama will balance governing and campaigning this week, romney will also face the task of adopting the right tone during a time of crisis for a large chunk of the east coast. a top republican conceded even __"weather-safe"__ swing states such as colorado and ohio might be difficult campaign stops for romney if hurricane sandy __devastates__ the eastern seaboard with widespread injuries, deaths or life-threatening situations. disasters, natural and otherwise, are always a difficult balancing act for politicians of all stripes who don't want to be seen as __uncaring,__ even if there is little for them to do. "it gets __tricky,"__ the source __conceded.__ __"optics__ are important." that source said the romney campaign will "play it by __ear"__ as the storm __unfolds.__ romney campaign spokesman kevin madden said sunday afternoon that campaign workers in virginia "are doing as much as they can to help with relief efforts." the former massachusetts governor and the president have already canceled stops in virginia, a pivotal swing state expected to be hard hit. vice president joe biden canceled a saturday event in virginia and one scheduled for monday in new hampshire. both campaigns cited a desire not to use resources better targeted toward __pre-storm__ __preparations.__ __crowley:__ sandy introduces big unknown into campaign . ann romney, who was slated to campaign in new hampshire on monday, canceled her events, and the romney campaign said the bus that was to be used for her visit would instead be deployed for __"relief__ efforts throughout the east __coast."__ both campaigns said they were suspending fundraising e-mails to supporters in virginia, pennsylvania, north carolina, new jersey and the district of columbia. obama canceled trips to the battlegrounds of ohio and colorado to stay in washington and monitor the oncoming storm, though a campaign trip to florida remained on the president's schedule for monday. romney is scheduled to campaign in ohio, iowa and wisconsin on monday, then in ohio on tuesday. a romney campaign stop scheduled for tuesday in new hampshire was canceled late sunday afternoon, the campaign announced in an __e-mai.__ opinion: how sandy will test obama, romney . madden said the campaign would continue to update romney's calendar, based on where the storm goes. "the schedule we have locked down for now are in states that are not directly impacted by the storm," he said. "but, again, we're going to continue to update it. we're going to continue to monitor the situation and stay in close contact with folks that are in the states that have the best information." this is the second time the campaign has been affected by a major weather event. hurricane isaac forced the cancellation of the first day of the republican national convention in tampa, florida, in august. asked whether the romney campaign felt __snake-bitten__ by mother nature, madden said, "well, there's certain things we can't control and nature's one of them. so we just try to have focus on what we can control and part of what we can control is making sure that safety is a priority for the people that are in harm's way in some of these states that are going to be directly impacted and so that's a top concern and it'll remain a top concern." while the political experts navigated the ramifications of the storm, at least one campaign had more practical matters in mind. tim __kaine,__ the democratic senate candidate in virginia, e-mailed supporters to ask them to take their yard signs down during the storm, lest they become __projectiles.__

(cnn) -- the biology professor charged in the shooting deaths friday of three faculty members at the university of alabama in __huntsville__ fatally shot her brother more than 23 years ago, police said saturday. amy bishop anderson, who was then known as amy bishop, was never charged in her brother's death, __braintree,__ massachusetts, police chief paul frazier told reporters. police records detailing the 1986 incident are missing, and a log of the incident lists it as an accidental shooting, he said. but the account told by frazier differs from the one published at the time by a boston newspaper. "it is a far different story i believe than what was reported back then," frazier said. "i cannot tell you what the thought process was behind our releasing her at the time." a december 8, 1986, article in the boston globe states that anderson asked her mother how to unload a round from a 12-gauge shotgun and accidentally shot her brother while she was handling the weapon. the article cited __then-police__ chief john polio as the source. however, frazier said an officer, who was involved in the case and still works for the department, told him that anderson shot her brother in the chest during an argument. the woman allegedly fired a shot in her bedroom without hitting anyone, then argued with her brother and shot him. she fired yet another round in the home before __fleeing,__ frazier said. police arrested anderson after she pointed a weapon at a vehicle near the house in an attempt to get the driver to stop, but it drove on, frazier said. but during the booking process, chief polio called and told the officers to release her, frazier said. in a telephone call with cnn, polio -- now 87 and retired -- denied ever calling in the order. he said detectives had interviewed anderson and her mother -- judith baker, who was a member of the police department's personnel board -- as well as the lead investigator, capt. theodore __buker,__ who has since died. __buker__ told him that the shooting appeared accidental and the two men agreed she should be released to her mother, polio said. a request was then filed with the office of district attorney bill __delahunt__ to conduct an inquiry, but __delahunt__ never did so, he said. __delahunt,__ now a democratic congressman representing massachusetts, was in jerusalem on saturday and unable to comment on the case, spokesman mark forest told cnn. polio acknowledged that an argument had occurred during the shooting and said that the other shots, including one fired into the ceiling, did not appear aimed at anyone. he also recalled that anderson had fled the scene. but, he said, he could not remember what he had told the newspaper in reference to the case or why details, including the argument, were not reported. polio rejected as __"laughable"__ any suggestions that the suspect's mother might have influenced their handling of the case. "there was no cover up," polio said. "absolutely no cover up and no missing records. the records were all there when i left. where they went in the last 22 years and two police chiefs __subsequent,__ i don't know." anderson, a __harvard-educated__ professor, has been charged with capital murder. __huntsville__ police chief henry reyes said anderson, 45, was attending a faculty meeting on the third floor of the sciences building friday afternoon when she shot six colleagues, killing three. anderson, a professor and researcher at the university, was arrested as she was leaving the building, reyes told reporters saturday. he said a 9 mm handgun was recovered from the second floor of the building late friday. anderson is charged with one count of capital murder, a crime that involved two or more intentional deaths and is eligible for the death penalty in alabama. madison county district attorney rob __broussard__ said officials were considering other charges, including attempted murder. university spokesman ray garner has identified the dead as __gopi__ __podila,__ chairman of the biological sciences __department;__ maria davis, associate professor of __biology;__ and __adriel__ johnson, associate professor of biology. the injured were joseph leahy, associate professor of biology, in critical __condition;__ luis __cruz-vera,__ assistant professor of biology, in stable __condition;__ and stephanie __monticello,__ staff assistant, also in stable condition. they were taken to __huntsville__ hospital. authorities have not ruled out the possibility of other suspects in connection with the shooting. investigators have interviewed anderson's husband, __jim.__ anderson had been working at the university since 2003 and was up for tenure, garner said. however, authorities wouldn't discuss possible motives or whether the issue of tenure may have played a role in the shooting. garner said the meeting at shelby hall was for faculty and staff in the sciences department, but he gave no other details. the incident occurred shortly before 4 p.m. (5 p.m. et), and residence halls were locked down 10 minutes later. an alert notifying the campus about the incident was issued at __4:42__ p.m. __ct.__ pressed on the amount of time that passed before a campus alert was sent notifying students and faculty about the shooting and the lockdown, university police chief chuck __gailes__ said the lag "didn't impact the safety of people on campus and in the building." he said there is no specific timeframe that dictates how quickly such an alert is issued, but he said it would be an issue officials will look into. university president david williams said there would be a prayer service sunday. "we are a resilient community, and we know we will come together to overcome these difficult times," he said. williams said the campus would open for employees next week but there would be no classes. __kourtney__ __lattimore,__ a 19-year-old sophomore studying __nursing,__ was one of about 100 students who attended the suspect's anatomy class from __10:20__ to __11:15__ a.m. __friday.,__ when the subject included __neurons.__ "nothing seemed to be off at all," she said about her teacher, who wore a pink sweater in class. "we were all shocked, like, all of us just couldn't believe it." __lattimore__ said her anatomy class was not the only one affected by friday's events. leahy -- who was wounded in the shooting -- taught her infection and immunity class, she said. reached at the couple's home, jim anderson told cnn that his wife has an attorney whom he would not __identify.__ he described his wife as a good teacher.

european officials reacted with fury sunday to a report that the u.s. national security agency spied on eu offices. the european union warned that if the report is accurate, it will have tremendous repercussions. "i am deeply worried and shocked about the allegations," european parliament president martin schulz said in a statement. "if the allegations prove to be true, it would be an extremely serious matter which will have a severe impact on __eu-us__ relations. on behalf of the european parliament, i demand full clarification and require further information __speedily__ from the u.s. authorities with regard to these allegations." german justice minister sabine __leutheusser-schnarrenberger__ "said if the accusations were true, it was reminiscent of the cold war," ministry spokesman anders __mertzlufft__ said, adding that the minister "has asked for an immediate explanation from the united states." french foreign minister laurent fabius called for a swift explanation from american authorities. "these acts, if they are confirmed, would be absolutely unacceptable," he said in a statement. the outrage from european officials over the weekend was the latest fallout since edward snowden, a former national security agency computer contractor, started spilling details of u.s. surveillance programs to reporters earlier this month. citing information from secret documents obtained by snowden, the german news magazine der spiegel reported sunday that several u.s. spying operations targeted european union leaders. der spiegel said it had "in part __seen"__ documents from snowden that describe how the national security agency __bugged__ eu officials' washington and new york offices and conducted an __"electronic__ eavesdropping operation" that tapped into a eu building in brussels, belgium. the magazine's report also says that nsa spying has targeted telephone and internet connection data in germany more than any other european nation. an average of up to 20 million phone connections and 10 million internet data connections are surveyed daily, der spiegel said, noting that the intensity of surveillance puts the u.s. ally on par with china, iraq and saudi arabia. another report sunday claimed that surveillance extended beyond european offices. the guardian newspaper reported that one nsa document leaked by snowden describes 38 embassies and missions as __"targets"__ and details surveillance methods that include planting bugs in communications equipment and collecting transmissions with specialized __antennae.__ targets included france, italy, greece, japan, mexico, south korea, india and turkey, according to the guardian. cnn has not independently confirmed the allegations in the reports from der spiegel and the guardian. u.s. officials did not immediately respond to the guardian's report. the office of the director of national intelligence declined to comment sunday on specific allegations published in der __spiegel.__ "the united states government will respond appropriately to the european union through our diplomatic channels, and through the __eu/u.s.__ experts' dialogue on intelligence that the u.s. proposed several weeks ago," the office said in a statement. "we will also discuss these issues __bilaterally__ with eu member states. while we are not going to comment publicly on specific alleged intelligence activities, as a matter of policy, we have made clear that the united states gathers foreign intelligence of the type gathered by all nations." ben rhodes, white house deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, said he had not seen the report and "would not comment on unauthorized disclosures of intelligence programs. the intelligence community would be the most appropriate to do that." rhodes added that "those are some of our closest intelligence partners, so it's worth noting that the europeans work very closely with us. ____ we have very close intelligence relationships with them." father proposes deal for snowden's voluntary return . u.s. asks ecuador to reject any asylum request from snowden . michael hayden, a former director of the nsa and cia, told "face the nation" on cbs on sunday morning that he didn't know whether the report was true. "i've been out of government for about five years, so i really don't know, and even if i did, i wouldn't confirm or deny it," he said. "but i think i can confirm a few things for you here this morning. number one, the united states does conduct espionage. number two, our fourth amendment, which protects americans' privacy, is not an international treaty. and number three, any european who wants to go out and __rend__ their garments with regard to international espionage should look first and find out what their governments are doing." european union spokeswoman marlene __holzner,__ in a e-mail to cnn, said, "we have immediately been in contact with the u.s. authorities in washington d.c. and in brussels and have confronted them with the press reports. they have told us they are checking on the accuracy of the information released yesterday and will come back to us." in brussels, der spiegel says, the agency targeted the __justus__ __lipsius__ building, which houses the european council and the eu council of ministers, the union's main decision-making and legislative body. and in washington, the magazine report claims, the nsa installed bugs in the european union's building and infiltrated its computer network. der __spiegel's__ report comes as negotiations for a trans-atlantic trade agreement between the united states and the european union are set to start next month in washington. obama: pay no attention to that man we can't capture . snowden has revealed himself as the source of documents outlining a massive effort by the nsa to track cell phone calls and monitor the e-mail and internet traffic of virtually all americans. critics slam him as a __traitor.__ supporters hail him as a hero. now snowden, who faces espionage charges in the united states, is in russia and seeking asylum from ecuador. u.s. vice president joe biden asked ecuador "to please __reject"__ the request for asylum, according to ecuadorian president rafael __correa.__ "that's not __acceptable,"__ wikileaks founder julian assange told abc's "this week" on sunday. assange, whose organization facilitates the release of classified documents and is assisting snowden's asylum bid, said he couldn't reveal details about the former nsa __contractor's__ specific location or the status of his case. he criticized u.s. officials for pressuring ecuador on the matter. __"asylum__ is a right that we all have. it's an international right. the united states has been founded largely on accepting political refugees from other countries and has __prospered__ by it. mr. snowden has that right," said __assange.__ __"ideally,__ he should be able to return to the united states. unfortunately, that's not the world that we live in and hopefully another country will give him the justice that he __deserves."__ former cuban leader fidel castro weighed in on sunday. in a letter to nicaraguan president daniel ortega published in cuban state media, castro praised ecuador's president for standing up to u.s. threats over snowden. on saturday night, correa said the ball was in russia's court. "we didn't ask to be in this situation. mr. snowden has been in touch with mr. assange, who recommended he ask for asylum in ecuador. in order to process this request, he needs to be in ecuadorian territory," correa said in an interview with ecuador's __oromar__ tv on saturday night. "at this point, the solution for snowden's final destination is in the hands of the russian authorities." russian president vladimir putin has said it's up to snowden to figure out his next step. "the sooner he selects his final destination point, the better both for us and for himself," putin said. a top russian lawmaker said sunday that russia must not hand snowden over to the united states. "it's not a matter of snowden's __usefulness__ to russia, it's a matter of __principle,"__ alexei __pushkov__ -- who heads the international affairs committee at the __duma,__ the lower house of parliament -- said on twitter. "he is a political refugee and handing him over is morally unacceptable," he said. the man behind the nsa leaks . why we're all stuck in the digital transit zone with snowden .

beijing (cnn) -- china on thursday unveiled the elite group of leaders who will set the agenda for the country for the next decade, the culmination of months of secretive bargaining and a carefully choreographed performance of political __pomp.__ the seven members of the powerful committee that sits atop the chinese system strode out onto a stage in the great hall of the people in beijing. they were led by xi jinping, who takes over from hu jintao as head of the communist party, which has ruled china for more than 60 years. xi is joined on the new politburo standing committee, the party's top decision-making body, by li __keqiang,__ who is expected to replace wen jiabao as premier early next year, and five other veteran party officials. although the committee's lineup is new, analysts said it appeared to be predominantly conservative and unlikely to bring about meaningful political changes in the world's most populous nation and second largest economy. china's new __leaders:__ who's who . xi also succeeded hu as head of china's powerful central military commission, which oversees major national security and military affairs. that makes for a cleaner transition than in the past two power __handovers,__ when the former party chiefs held onto the key military role for years afterward, using it to keep exercising considerable power and influence. a far cry from the relentless media campaigns and frequent public appearances of u.s. presidential candidates, the efforts to determine who ended up in china's most powerful posts have taken place behind closed doors, part of a __once-in-a-decade__ leadership transition. the focal point of the process has been the party's 18th national congress that has unfolded amid heavy security in beijing over the past week. shadow of former president looms over china's new leaders . despite the spectacular economic and social changes china has undergone in recent times, the party has maintained a tight grip on power and upheld its obscure methods for selecting its top leaders. the consequences of the leadership handover are significant for the nation's 1.3 billion citizens, its neighbors in asia and the united states, which is __warily__ watching china's economic and military rise. standing in front of a huge landscape painting on thursday, xi brought a touch of __cordiality__ to the start of his speech before a packed room of reporters, __apologetically__ acknowledging that he and his party colleagues had kept their audience waiting by appearing later than scheduled. but he quickly turned to serious matters, warning of the "many severe __challenges"__ that the party faces. he singled out corruption, __remoteness__ from the general public, as well as undue emphasis on __formalities__ and bureaucracy as particular concerns. experts detail 5 challenges for china . the secrecy and __exclusivity__ of the procedure by which china's top leaders are __selected,__ involving maneuvering and __deal-making__ among senior party figures, leaves a lot of the country's citizens feeling detached from the process. "many ordinary people don't feel so excited or joyful about what's happening," said __lijia__ zhang, a beijing-based author. "people say, 'oh, it's the party's business, nothing to do with us -- and we do not have a say in selecting the leader or the __policy.'__ " but xi's speech had more of a human touch than many of those delivered by chinese officials, and he addressed subjects close to the heart of many chinese people and others around the world. "our people have great enthusiasm in life," he said. "they hope for better education, more stable jobs, more satisfactory income, more reliable social security, medical services with higher standards, more comfortable living conditions and a more beautiful environment." what kind of changes xi, 59, and those joining him on the party's most powerful committee are likely to usher in over the coming years remains shrouded in mystery. __"xi__ jinping is in many ways an unknown __commodity,"__ said mike __chinoy,__ a former cnn correspondent and now a senior fellow at the university of southern california's u.s.-china institute.

"by and large, we have a conservative team," lam said following the announcement of the new standing committee.

(cnn) -- the fatal gang rape of a young woman in the indian capital of new delhi sparked weeks of angry protests and prompted heated debates about the __pervasiveness__ of sexual violence in indian society. cnn asked people in india and the indian diaspora for their thoughts on the case and the subsequent charges brought against six people, and also asked women for their personal experiences. responses ranged from anger at the system, which they feel failed the young woman who died, to recollections of the harassment they have suffered personally. "i have been __hooted__ at, i've been called names and told to dress __modestly,__ and let me remind you this is from people my own age and not older conservative people," said charity consultant __meera__ __vijayann__ from __bangalore.__ ireporter: rape __'still__ not seen as a human rights violation in __india'__ "this girl could have been me, it could have been any of my friends and no-one would have taken us seriously." proposals to install "fast track" courts for rape cases marked a promising start, she said, but she added that it would take more than just statutes to stop such __tragedies.__ violence against women in india is widespread. more than 220,000 incidents were reported in 2011 alone, according to indian government statistics. human rights activists point out that, due to under reporting, the real figure is most likely much higher. but it's not just the statistics -- it's the __mindset,__ many indians said. following the attack, there was further outrage when the indian president's son, __abhijeet__ __mukherjee,__ dismissed women who had flocked to the streets to protest against the case as __"dented__ and __painted,"__ comments for which he later apologized. read more: the perils of being a woman in india . such __victim-blaming,__ they said, must stop. "there is a sexist __mindset,__ politicians have made silly remarks about women and how they should wear modest clothes, not go to parties," __vijayann__ said. "if they make the laws how will it benefit us? people have to change the way they think." despite such comments making headlines, many indian men were quick to express their outrage at the attack. __akash__ __bhattacharya,__ a software engineer from __bangalore,__ attended some of the protests and candlelight vigils that erupted in indian cities after reports of the case emerged in local media. he said he had felt __"ashamed"__ as a man to hear the news and called for a shift in attitudes towards women and how they are treated. ireporter: 'i'm ashamed as a man in my own __country'__ __"harsher__ punishment will stop a case here and there, but that will not change our mind set," he said. "when will our conscience __overpower__ our __instincts?"__ __siddharth__ __katragadda,__ an artist and writer from india now living in san diego, california, said that for the first time in india's history, "we're realizing that we cannot protect our women by hiding them behind tradition and values." india, he said, was experiencing a __schism__ between a value system that relied on shutting women away to one where external forces such as the police and the criminal justice system were looked to for support and justice. "for centuries, india protected its women against such crimes by hiding __[them]__ behind strict rules of personal fashion and even stricter __traditions,"__ he said. "now, urban indians look -- as the west does -- to its laws and policing to protect its women. what we're seeing is clash of those opposing __cultures."__ more: __'india__ has woken up and realized that change is __needed'__ nonetheless, he was also quick to point out that india is far from the only country with endemic sexual violence. __"rapes__ are crimes of opportunity that occur in every corner of the world, not just india," he said. five of the suspects were formally charged on thursday with the murder, rape and kidnapping in a new delhi court, senior police officials said, while another is awaiting age tests to determine if he is old enough to be tried in an adult court. several of the charges carry the death penalty if they are convicted. there are hopes amongst indians that the potent mix of public anger, political nervousness and global pressure may impress on authorities the need for action to prevent such crimes happening again. the sheer horror of the case has also increased calls from some protesters for use of the death penalty, which is legal but rarely used in india. images of angry demonstrators carrying mock __hangman's__ __nooses__ and signs calling for the suspects to be killed have left little doubt that there are some in india keen for this sentence to be carried out if the men are convicted. others, however, were more __circumspect,__ citing sanctity for life, or the possibility of rehabilitation or change. "i believe rape is the most grave crime as the victims die two times, once physically and one emotionally, so the __[suspects]__ must be given severe punishment __[if__ __convicted]__ which can make them realize how painful it is," said __dorjay__ __namgail__ from __chandigarh,__ northern india, on facebook. "but i think we should abandon capital punishment. every human being has the capacity [to] transform themselves into a good, law abiding citizen." more: remembering the new delhi gang rape victim . the sheer tragedy of the case has also prompted some outside of india to take action, from sharing thoughts and condolences on social media to organizing vigils in honor of the unnamed victim. __reena__ __combo,__ a media specialist living in birmingham, england, whose family comes from new delhi, decided to organize a vigil after her tweets about the case sparked an outpouring of emotional responses and pleas to take action. "people were saying 'you work in media -- you can do __something!'"__ she said. "so i decided to put together a vigil in my home town." "a lot of people want to pay their respects and show solidarity for this woman who died in such a traumatic way. hopefully now indian women will feel more empowered to speak out." opinion: end culture of rape in 2013 .

buenos aires, argentina (cnn) -- federal officials said monday they are probing allegations by a former investigator into the deadliest terrorist attack in argentine history that he was kidnapped and tortured by men who said they were national intelligence agents. claudio __lifschitz__ shows off the scars he says kidnappers carved on his back. claudio __lifschitz,__ 43, said three hooded men threw him into the back of a truck on friday night and put a plastic bag over his head. they then questioned him on details of the probe into the bombing of the argentine jewish mutual association __(amia)__ building in buenos aires on july 18, 1994, he said. __eighty-five__ people died and more than 200 were injured in one of the bloodiest anti-semitic attacks in the world since world war ii.

(cnn) -- aung san suu kyi, the myanmar democratic freedom activist who spent 15 years under house arrest, accepted the u.s. congressional gold medal on wednesday. suu kyi called the ceremony one of the most moving days of her life. "from the depths of my heart, i thank you, the people of america and you, their __representatives,"__ she said to the gathered members of congress, "for keeping us in your hearts and minds during the dark years when freedom and justice seemed beyond our __reach."__ sen. john mccain was overcome with emotion when he, among other political heavyweights in washington, praised suu __kyi.__ mccain called suu kyi "his personal hero." "they did all they could to break her," the arizona republican said of the military junta that detained her. mccain, who was a pow in vietnam, choked up, his voice __breaking.__ __"aung__ san suu kyi didn't scare a __damn,"__ he told the crowd. mccain's comments were met with wild applause. suu kyi was kept for the better part of two decades under house arrest for advocating for democracy in myanmar, also known as burma. the country's former military rulers ordered her detention, and in recent years her case has received an international spotlight. she paid a hefty personal price for standing up for freedom in myanmar, which suffered under 50 years of __autocratic,__ repressive rule. suu kyi, who was awarded the medal in 2008, was freed two years later and elected to the myanmar parliament this year, a historic moment in the country. "as i go forward with my countrymen and __-women__ along the difficult path of building a truly democratic society where all our people can live together in peace -- remembering always that burma is a nation of many ethnic nationalities and peoples -- we believe that we can go forward in unity and in peace, and give our friends the satisfaction of helping us get to ... a place where dreams are __realized,"__ she said in her acceptance speech. the 67-year-old __activist-turned-politician__ is on a __17-day__ tour of the united states. suu kyi met with president barack obama later wednesday. obama "expressed his admiration for her courage, determination and personal sacrifice in championing democracy and human rights over the years," the white house said in a statement following the meeting. he told suu kyi that the united states will continue to support the efforts of her and her party, in conjunction with the reformist myanmar president, thein __sein,__ to push for political and economic changes and "to ensure full protection of the fundamental rights of the burmese people," according to the statement. over the next two weeks, suu kyi is scheduled to meet with other high-level american officials, as well as democratic activists. also wednesday, she met with u.s. sens. harry reid, d-nevada, and john kerry, d-massachusetts, among others. at the start of her visit tuesday, she met with secretary of state hillary clinton and made an address at the u.s. institute of peace in washington, during which she said she supported the further easing of u.s. economic sanctions on myanmar. "i do not think we should depend on u.s. sanctions to keep up the momentum of our movement for democracy," she said. "we have got to work at it ourselves." the u.s. treasury department, meanwhile, lifted sanctions wednesday on thein sein and parliament member __thura__ __shwe__ mann, allowing them do do business with americans again. also wednesday, clinton compared suu kyi with another famous political prisoner. she said she was reminded when she visited suu kyi during her house arrest that she saw similarities to nelson mandela. "these two political prisoners were separated by great __distances,__ but they were both marked by uncommon grace, generosity of spirit and __unshakable__ will," clinton said wednesday. "and they both understood something we all have to grasp. the day they walked out of prison, the day the house arrest was ended, was not the end of the struggle. it was the beginning of a new __phase."__ under thein __sein,__ the myanmar government has released hundreds of political prisoners in the past year, part of a series of reforms that have followed decades of repressive military rule. western governments have responded to the efforts by starting to ease sanctions put in place to pressure the military regime. myanmar authorities have also engaged in peace talks with rebel ethnic groups and allowed suu kyi's party, the national league for democracy, to successfully participate in special elections for the national parliament in april. suu kyi and others have nonetheless cautioned that progress toward greater freedoms in myanmar remains embryonic and __fragile.__ "i think one of the important reasons for her visit at this time is to remind us of how much more still lies ahead, from strengthening the rule of law in democratic institutions to addressing the challenges in many of the ethnic conflicts and in rakhine state," clinton said tuesday in an introduction to suu kyi's address. communal violence between buddhists and muslims in the western myanmar state of rakhine this summer killed scores of people and displaced thousands of others. human rights advocates have accused the authorities of cracking down particularly harshly on the __rohingya,__ a stateless ethnic muslim minority, during the unrest. suu kyi's u.s. trip coincides with a visit to new york by thein sein to attend the u.n. general assembly, where he will meet with clinton. on monday, the myanmar government announced that it was releasing more than 500 prisoners as part of an amnesty. suu kyi said tuesday that her party calculates that there were about 90 political prisoners among those released. between 200 and 400 political prisoners remain behind bars in myanmar, according to different estimates. earlier this year, suu kyi visited thailand, her first trip abroad since her release from house arrest, and then traveled to europe, where she finally collected the nobel peace prize she was awarded in 1991. as part of her u.s. tour, she will visit fort wayne, indiana, home to one of the united states' largest populations of burmese __expatriates.__ since the early 1990s, about 5,000 burmese have carved out a life there. cnn's ashley fantz in atlanta; and jethro mullen and paul armstrong in hong kong contributed to this report.

(cnn) -- fresh white smoke rose again monday from japan's fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant, caused by an explosion at a building tied to the facility's no. 3 reactor. japan's chief cabinet secretary yukio edano said that, according to the head of the nuclear facility, the container vessel surrounding the reactor is still intact. initial reports suggest that radiation levels rose following the explosion late monday morning, but edano said he does not believe there has been a massive leak. "we are now collecting information on the concentration of __radiation,"__ he said. a wall of the building collapsed due to the blast, according to japanese public broadcaster __nhk,__ which showed plumes of smoke above the plant. the secretary said that water continues to be injected into the plant's no. 3 reactor. that fact, and the pressure levels, has led authorities to believe that the reactor itself remains intact. the incident is the latest affecting the __daiichi,__ the hardest hit of several nuclear plants affected since friday's __8.9-magnitude__ earthquake and subsequent tsunami. officials said that the explosion was likely caused by a buildup of hydrogen gas, similar to what had happened saturday at the same nuclear plant's no. 1 reactor. the 600 residents remaining within 20 kilometers (12 miles) of the plant, despite an earlier evacuation order, have been ordered to stay indoors, according to __edano.__ officials earlier said that they were operating on the presumption that there may be a partial meltdown in the no. 3 and no. 1 nuclear reactors at the daiichi plant. authorities have not yet been able to confirm a meltdown, because it is too hot inside the affected reactors to check. the tokyo electric power company, which runs the plant, said in a press release late sunday that radiation levels outside that plant remain high. japan's kyodo __newsagency,__ citing the same company, said that there were measurements of __751__ __microsieverts__ and 650 __microsieverts__ of radiation early monday. both are above the legal limit, albeit less than one reading recorded sunday. a __microsievert__ is an internationally recognized unit measuring radiation __dosage,__ with people typically exposed during an entire year to a total of about 1,000 __microsieverts.__ on sunday, chief cabinet secretary yukio edano said accumulating hydrogen gas "may potentially cause an __explosion"__ in the building housing the no. 3 reactor at the daiichi plant. at another plant, in __onagawa,__ authorities early sunday noted high radiation levels. ____ the international atomic energy agency said later -- using information from officials in japan -- levels returned to "normal" and found no emissions of __radioactivity"__ from __onagawa's__ three reactors. "the current assumption of the japanese authorities is that the increased level may have been due to a release of radioactive material from the fukushima daiichi nuclear power __plant"__ located 135 kilometers (about 85 miles) north of __onagawa,__ the agency said. japan's nuclear and industrial safety agency said late sunday the wind was moving __north/northwest__ -- which could carry airborne radioactive material near the city of sendai and toward the __onagawa__ facility. most experts aren't expecting a reprise of the 1986 chernobyl meltdown, which killed 32 plant workers and firefighters in the former soviet union and at least 4,000 from cancers tied to radioactive material released by the plant. but in some ways -- especially the fact multiple reactors are affected, versus one in chernobyl -- japan's crisis is unique. "this is __unprecedented,"__ said stephanie __cooke,__ the author of "in mortal __hands:__ a cautionary history of the nuclear age." "you've never had a situation with multiple reactors at risk." these issues come despite japan's solid reputation in the nuclear power field. japan is heavily dependent on the energy source, with 54 plants and eight slated for construction, said __aileen__ __mioko__ smith of green action, an environmental group. __daiichi's__ no. 1 reactor -- the oldest of the six units at the site, according to world nuclear association, all of which are __boiling-water__ reactors -- became operational in november 1970. "nuclear facilities in japan ... were built to withstand earthquakes -- but not an __8.9__ earthquake," said james walsh, a cnn contributor and research associate at mit's security studies program. the crisis has stoked fears of a full-on nuclear meltdown, a catastrophic failure of the reactor core that has the potential for widespread release of radiation. high levels of __hydrogen,__ as evidenced at __daiichi,__ is one sign that a meltdown may be __occurring.__ so, too, is the detection noted of radioactive cesium outside that plant, according to __toshihiro__ __bannai,__ an official with japan's nuclear and industrial safety agency. this could be caused by the melting of fuel rods inside the reactor, indicating at least a partial meltdown. despite such evidence, __noriyuki__ __shikata,__ a spokesman for prime minister naoto kan repeated __edano's__ assertion that the situation is "under control" and said he would not describe what was occurring in the reactors as a __"meltdown."__ but __cooke,__ also editor of nuclear intelligence weekly for the __atomic-energy__ community, said she's not convinced authorities have a full handle on what she called "this hugely dangerous technology." "the more they say they're in control, the more i sense things may be out of control," she said. the daiichi plant has a containment vessel, which theoretically would capture radioactive material if a full meltdown occurs. in the meantime, government and power company officials are working to prevent even such a calamity -- even if it means rendering the daiichi plant __inoperable.__ authorities ordered the injection of sea water and __boron__ into the affected reactors, even though salt and __boron__ will __corrode__ the reactor. __"essentially,__ they are waving the white flag and saying, 'this plant is __done,'"__ walsh said. "this is a last-ditch mechanism to try to prevent overheating and to prevent a partial or full __meltdown."__ edano has said there have been no leaks of radioactive material at any plants. radioactive steam has been released intentionally to lessen growing pressure in the two daiichi reactors -- in an amount authorities have described as minimal. still, on sunday, edano said nine people who were evacuated from near the daiichi plant tested positive for high radiation on skin and clothing. this is in addition to at least three electric company workers who fell ill due to possible exposure, the tokyo electric power co. said in a statement. even if there's is no further catastrophe, the nuclear situation -- part of what prime minister kan called the __"toughest__ and most difficult crisis for __japan"__ since the end of world war ii -- has clearly made an impact. cooke said that it may take years to fully assess the damage at the worst-hit reactors, much less to get them working again. and authorities may never definitively determine how much radiation was __emitted,__ or how many got sick because of it. then there's the short- and long-term impact of japan's electric __grid:__ soon after the quake, power was knocked out to 10% of japan's households. most of those people now have electricity, though experts say it is highly unlikely the most affected reactors will ever be operational again. beyond that, the crisis may have a significant impact the nuclear power movement. walsh noted that while some countries, like china, may go forward in creating new reactors, others planned for south korea, turkey and elsewhere may pull back. but assessing the far-reaching implications of the crisis isn't the top priority now. instead, the focus is more on making sure that the situation does not deteriorate even further and put more lives at risk. if the effort to cool the nuclear fuel inside the reactor fails completely -- a scenario that experts who have spoken to cnn say is unlikely -- the resulting release of radiation could cause enormous damage to the plant and/or release radiation into the atmosphere or water. that could lead to widespread cancer and other health problems, experts say. authorities have downplayed such a scenario, insisting the situation appears under control and that radiation levels in the air are not dangerous. still, as what they described as "a __precaution,"__ at least 180,000 people who live within 20 kilometers (12 miles) of the plant have been ordered to leave. "the bottom line is that we just don't know what's going to happen in the next couple of days and, frankly, neither do the people who run the system," added dr. ira __helfand,__ a member of the board of physicians for social responsibility. cnn's greg botelho and tom watkins contributed to this report.

(cnn) -- basketball hall of famer and former los angeles clippers general manager __elgin__ baylor told cnn's "anderson cooper 360" that he had arguments with donald sterling about his views on race. "he would say, 'well, that's the way i feel," baylor said in his first national television remarks about sterling since the scandal unfolded. __"occasionally__ it might come up about players." __baylor,__ who lost a lawsuit alleging he was fired by the team because of his age, said sterling never directed racist language at him. but when asked if the longtime owner who now is banned for life from the league was a racist, baylor didn't pause. "of course he is," baylor said in an interview telecast on wednesday. "there's no doubt in my mind now." __baylor's__ wife, __elaine,__ __elaborated.__ "he's not running around with a white robe on," she told cooper. "he's not that __blatant.__ he's a very smart man, but he communicates how he feels and what he wants, especially to people who work for him. so you know where he is and what he __wants."__ __elgin__ baylor said that he feels vindicated by the racist remarks that were released in an audio recording on __tmz's__ website last month even though he lost in court. __baylor's__ suit originally included the accusation that he was canned because of racism but that was taken out of the lawsuit. "justice has been __served,"__ he said. "now they know what donald is like, and the things i said before about donald are absolutely true." one of those things baylor had related was how sterling on "many __occasions"__ would bring women into the locker room and look at the players in the __showers.__ "look at those beautiful black bodies. that's what he used to say," the nba legend said. baylor said he told sterling several times to quit before the owner finally did so. the former gm, who spent 22 years directing player __acquisitions,__ also told cnn how sterling asked him to go out early in his career and scout playgrounds in the inner cities to see if he could find any talented players. the nba is in the process of forcing sterling, who has owned the team since it was in san diego in 1981, to sell the franchise. baylor __foresees__ a potential legal fight. __"donald__ likes the __limelight,__ whether it's good or bad," he said. baylor was the clippers gm during many of their worst seasons. he joined the team in 1986 after a career in which he scored __23,149__ points, which puts him 33rd on the list of all-time __scorers__ in the nba, and a stint as the coach of new orleans jazz. the clippers were the joke of the league, though, and only made the playoffs three times. he was named nba executive of the year in 2006 when the clippers made the second round of the __postseason,__ but two years later, he said he was fired. the team said he resigned. the audio recordings brought back memories, baylor said. "it didn't surprise me ... at all," he said. "that's the donald sterling i know."

a policewoman narrowly escaped injury when a petrol bomb was thrown at a police car in belfast, police said, as tensions in northern ireland prompted by a vote on the flying of the union flag continue to __simmer.__ at the time of the attack, the car was stationed outside the office of alliance party lawmaker naomi long, who received a death threat last week. the police service of northern ireland is treating the incident as an attempted murder. long, the alliance party's sole lawmaker in the uk parliament at westminster, has called on british prime minister david cameron to intervene. read more: police: loyalist __paramilitaries__ behind northern ireland violence . the violent outbreaks were prompted by a decision on monday of last week by belfast city __councilors__ to stop flying the union flag year-round, restricting it instead to certain days. northern ireland first minister peter robinson condemned the attack, saying: "the attempted murder of a police officer in east belfast was a despicable act of terror. "the masked men responsible do not act in the name of our union __flag.Â they__ are bringing shame on it. my prayers are with the police officers at the center of this attack." robinson, of the democratic unionist party, said he defended the right to peaceful protest, but "those intent on violence should stay at home." read more: clinton urges calm amid tensions in northern ireland . about 32 police officers were injured in the past week's violence, assistant chief constable george hamilton said. there have been 38 arrests in connection with the loyalist disorder. "it is completely unacceptable that officers who were carrying out their professional duty on behalf of the community should be subjected to a potentially murderous attack," hamilton said of the petrol bomb attack. "this was a planned attempt to kill a police officer which also put the lives of the public in danger, and it is fortunate there were no injuries." clashes also broke out between groups of nationalist and loyalist youths in east belfast, police said. addressing parliament, secretary of state for northern ireland theresa villiers condemned the violence and appealed for calm. "there can be absolutely no excuse or justification for this kind of __thuggish__ and lawless behavior," she said. "nobody can be in any doubt about the government's support for the union and its flag. but those people engaged in the kind of violence we have seen in the past few days are not defending the union flag. they are __dishonoring__ and shaming the flag of our country." a number of properties linked to the __cross-community__ alliance party, which backed the decision to restrict the flying of the union flag, have been targeted in the week since the vote. alliance party councilor linda cleland said the windows of her car were smashed and several windows in her home broken over the weekend.

(cnn) -- the fatal gang rape of a young woman in the indian capital of new delhi sparked weeks of angry protests and prompted heated debates about the __pervasiveness__ of sexual violence in indian society. cnn asked people in india and the indian diaspora for their thoughts on the case and the subsequent charges brought against six people, and also asked women for their personal experiences. responses ranged from anger at the system, which they feel failed the young woman who died, to recollections of the harassment they have suffered personally. "i have been __hooted__ at, i've been called names and told to dress __modestly,__ and let me remind you this is from people my own age and not older conservative people," said charity consultant __meera__ __vijayann__ from __bangalore.__ ireporter: rape __'still__ not seen as a human rights violation in __india'__ "this girl could have been me, it could have been any of my friends and no-one would have taken us seriously." proposals to install "fast track" courts for rape cases marked a promising start, she said, but she added that it would take more than just statutes to stop such __tragedies.__ violence against women in india is widespread. more than 220,000 incidents were reported in 2011 alone, according to indian government statistics. human rights activists point out that, due to under reporting, the real figure is most likely much higher. but it's not just the statistics -- it's the __mindset,__ many indians said. following the attack, there was further outrage when the indian president's son, __abhijeet__ __mukherjee,__ dismissed women who had flocked to the streets to protest against the case as __"dented__ and __painted,"__ comments for which he later apologized. read more: the perils of being a woman in india . such __victim-blaming,__ they said, must stop. "there is a sexist __mindset,__ politicians have made silly remarks about women and how they should wear modest clothes, not go to parties," __vijayann__ said. "if they make the laws how will it benefit us? people have to change the way they think." despite such comments making headlines, many indian men were quick to express their outrage at the attack. __akash__ __bhattacharya,__ a software engineer from __bangalore,__ attended some of the protests and candlelight vigils that erupted in indian cities after reports of the case emerged in local media. he said he had felt __"ashamed"__ as a man to hear the news and called for a shift in attitudes towards women and how they are treated. ireporter: 'i'm ashamed as a man in my own __country'__ __"harsher__ punishment will stop a case here and there, but that will not change our mind set," he said. "when will our conscience __overpower__ our __instincts?"__ __siddharth__ __katragadda,__ an artist and writer from india now living in san diego, california, said that for the first time in india's history, "we're realizing that we cannot protect our women by hiding them behind tradition and values." india, he said, was experiencing a __schism__ between a value system that relied on shutting women away to one where external forces such as the police and the criminal justice system were looked to for support and justice. "for centuries, india protected its women against such crimes by hiding __[them]__ behind strict rules of personal fashion and even stricter __traditions,"__ he said. "now, urban indians look -- as the west does -- to its laws and policing to protect its women. what we're seeing is clash of those opposing __cultures."__ more: __'india__ has woken up and realized that change is __needed'__ nonetheless, he was also quick to point out that india is far from the only country with endemic sexual violence. __"rapes__ are crimes of opportunity that occur in every corner of the world, not just india," he said. five of the suspects were formally charged on thursday with the murder, rape and kidnapping in a new delhi court, senior police officials said, while another is awaiting age tests to determine if he is old enough to be tried in an adult court. several of the charges carry the death penalty if they are convicted. there are hopes amongst indians that the potent mix of public anger, political nervousness and global pressure may impress on authorities the need for action to prevent such crimes happening again. the sheer horror of the case has also increased calls from some protesters for use of the death penalty, which is legal but rarely used in india. images of angry demonstrators carrying mock __hangman's__ __nooses__ and signs calling for the suspects to be killed have left little doubt that there are some in india keen for this sentence to be carried out if the men are convicted. others, however, were more __circumspect,__ citing sanctity for life, or the possibility of rehabilitation or change. "i believe rape is the most grave crime as the victims die two times, once physically and one emotionally, so the __[suspects]__ must be given severe punishment __[if__ __convicted]__ which can make them realize how painful it is," said __dorjay__ __namgail__ from __chandigarh,__ northern india, on facebook. "but i think we should abandon capital punishment. every human being has the capacity [to] transform themselves into a good, law abiding citizen." more: remembering the new delhi gang rape victim . the sheer tragedy of the case has also prompted some outside of india to take action, from sharing thoughts and condolences on social media to organizing vigils in honor of the unnamed victim. __reena__ __combo,__ a media specialist living in birmingham, england, whose family comes from new delhi, decided to organize a vigil after her tweets about the case sparked an outpouring of emotional responses and pleas to take action.

"the passengers aboard malaysia airlines flight 17 had nothing to do with the conflict in eastern ukraine. they were families heading on vacation, students returning home from abroad, researchers trying to eradicate a deadly disease," u.s. ambassador to the united nations samantha power said monday. "those who were killed deserve to be treated with dignity and their families are crying out, as we have heard, for __closure."__ as presidents, prime ministers and ambassadors pointed fingers over who was responsible for the crash, father hans de __borst__ spoke out in a facebook post. he accused russian president vladimir putin, the ukrainian government and separatists of murdering his 17-year-old daughter, who was nearing the end of high school and planning to study engineering. "she was looking forward to it!" de __borst__ wrote.

"i can do nothing but wait for the bodies," she told cnn. "they can have everything, but the bodies have to come back. take their iphones, take their money, take everything." in malaysia, a group of families of victims meeting with government officials had just one request, state media reported. "that the bodies be brought back in whatever condition," malaysian government minister __datuk__ __seri__ __rohani__ said. in britain, hugo __hoare__ told the mirror that he was worried about whether rebels were taking care of the bodies of his 59-year-old brother andrew and the other crash victims. "i just hope whatever they are doing is humane and their intention is just to release them at the appropriate time. the first thing i thought was, what if they are going to use them as a bargaining __chip?"__ __hoare__ said. "we just have to follow normal pressure through diplomatic channels and just hope there is a decent resolution at the end of it." standing at amsterdam's __schipohl__ airport, just meters away from the place where her son and his girlfriend checked in for their flight last week, __fredriksz__ asked russian president vladimir putin for help. "mr. __putin,"__ she said, "please take care of my son and my daughter, to bring them home." her son, __bryce,__ 23, and his girlfriend daisy __oehlers__ were on their way to bali when the plane was downed in war-torn eastern ukraine. __fredriksz__ had bought the "beautiful young __couple"__ their tickets for a holiday after the death of __oehlers'__ mother 2ÃÂ½ months ago.

washington (cnn) -- bomb plots targeting the new york stock exchange and the city's subway were among more than 50 terrorist acts worldwide thwarted by top-secret surveillance programs since the 2001 al qaeda attacks on the united states, security officials said tuesday. the startling details disclosed at a house intelligence committee hearing reflected a unified effort by the obama administration and legislators to defend the telephone and e-mail surveillance made public this month by classified leaks to newspapers. testimony by gen. keith alexander, the national security agency director, as well as officials from the fbi, department of justice and the director of national intelligence office called the programs created under the patriot act in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks a vital tool against terrorist plots. joined by panel chairman rep. mike rogers and other legislators, they condemned the document leaks by former government contractor edward snowden as harmful to the united states and its allies. the leaks also led to what officials called widespread public misinformation about the surveillance programs that __necessitated__ the relatively rare open hearing by the intelligence panel, where they detailed previously classified information in order to set the record straight. it was the most comprehensive and specific defense of the surveillance methods that have come under ferocious criticism from civil liberties groups, some members of congress and others concerned about the reach of government into the private lives of citizens. national security and law enforcement officials repeated that the programs are tightly run with significant regulation and oversight by federal judges and congress. addressing the most basic questions that have emerged, rogers asked alexander if intelligence workers have the ability to simply __"flip__ a __switch"__ in order to listen to phone calls or read the emails of americans. when alexander replied "no," rogers asked again to reinforce the message for anyone listening. "so the technology does not exist for any individual or group of individuals at the nsa to flip a switch to listen to americans' phone calls or read their __e-mails?"__ he repeated. "that is __correct,"__ alexander answered. he and others also asserted that the leaks were egregious and carry huge consequences for national security. "i think it was irreversible and significant damage to this nation," alexander said when questioned by rep. michele __bachmann.__ "has this helped america's __enemies?"__ the conservative minnesota republican asked. "i believe it has and i believe it will hurt us and our allies," alexander said. president barack obama has defended the programs as necessary in an era of terror. in an interview with __pbs'__ charlie rose broadcast on monday night, obama said the situation requires a national debate on the balance between security and privacy. obama __bristles__ at suggestion he's shifted on snooping . alexander told a senate committee last week that the surveillance programs helped stop dozens of terror plots, but he was unable then to provide classified details. under pressure from rogers and other legislators, alexander joined law enforcement officials tuesday in making public some declassified details of the patriot act provisions. in recent years, alexander said, information __"gathered__ from these programs provided government with critical leads to prevent over 50 potential terrorist events in more than 20 countries around the world." details of most of the thwarted terrorism acts remain secret, but national security officials said they were working on __declassifying__ more information and could have a report to congress as early as this week. sean __joyce,__ the deputy fbi director, detailed how email surveillance of foreigners under one program helped authorities discover the two new york city plots. in the fall of 2009, joyce said, the nsa intercepted an e-mail from a suspected terrorist in pakistan. that person was talking with someone in the united states "about perfecting a recipe for __explosives,"__ he said. authorities identified __afghan-born__ najibullah zazi of denver. the fbi followed him to new york and eventually broke up planning to attack the city's subway system. zazi pleaded guilty and is currently in prison. snowden claims online obama expanded __'abusive'__ security . in the other new york case, the nsa was monitoring a "known __extremist"__ in yemen who was in contact with a person in the united states, joyce said. the fbi detected __"nascent__ __plotting"__ to bomb the stock exchange, long considered a target of terrorists, and the plotters were later convicted, according to __joyce.__ he also said e-mail surveillance disrupted an effort to attack the office of a danish newspaper that was threatened for publishing a cartoon of the prophet mohammed in 2006. the plot involved david __headley,__ a u.s citizen living in chicago. the fbi received intelligence at the time regarding his possible involvement in the 2008 mumbai terror attack that killed 164 people, joyce said. the nsa, through surveillance of an al qaeda-affiliated terrorist, found that headley was working on a plot to bomb the newspaper. headley later confessed to conducting surveillance and was convicted. he also pleaded guilty to conducting surveillance in the mumbai case. in a fourth case, secret surveillance __"tipped__ us off" to a person who had indirect contacts with a known terrorist group overseas, joyce said. "we were able to reopen this investigation, identify additional individuals through the legal process and were able to disrupt this terrorist activity," joyce said. in an exchange with __joyce,__ rep. mac __thornberry__ of texas said the case involved someone financing a designated terrorist group in somalia. rogers, who scheduled the hearing in recent days after alexander pledged to __declassify__ information on terror plots thwarted by the secret programs, said it was necessary to clear up public confusion caused by __misinformation.__ "if half the things i read in blog and other places were true, i wouldn't support it," the michigan republican said, later adding that skeptics "have no __understanding"__ of what is going on. in particular, he said snowden disclosed only a sliver of information about the programs without knowing the full extent of what they did and the strict regulation and oversight of them. "none of the things he talked about were __accurate,"__ rogers said of snowden. the hearing came one day after snowden defended his actions in leaking classified documents to britain's guardian __newpaper__ and the washington post. in a series of blog posts on the guardian website, the 29-year-old snowden said he disclosed the information because obama worsened __"abusive"__ surveillance practices instead of curtailing them as he promised as a presidential candidate. the former nsa contractor insisted that u.s. authorities have access to phone calls, e-mails and other communications far beyond constitutional __bounds.__ while he said legal restrictions can be easily __skirted__ by analysts at the nsa, fbi and cia, snowden stopped short of accusing authorities of violating specific laws. instead, he said __toothless__ regulations and policies were to blame for what he called __"suspicionless__ __surveillance,"__ and he warned that policies can be changed to allow further abuses. at tuesday's hearing, officials detailed how the programs operate and the judicial and legislative oversight involved, repeating several times how access to the content of e-mails or telephone calls -- or even the names of people involved -- required authorization. deputy attorney general james cole noted that basic phone records collected under section 215 of the patriot act were not protected by fourth amendment rights to privacy, citing a 1979 supreme court ruling. in the case, smith v. maryland, the justices ruled that information about telephone calls -- such as their time and duration -- was different from the content of the calls and therefore not protected under the fourth amendment. cole also provided a detailed description of the legal framework of the programs, noting that the anti-terrorism surveillance effort is not "off the __books"__ or __"hidden__ away." "this is part of what government puts together and __discusses,"__ he said. __"statutes__ are passed. it is overseen by three branches of our government -- the legislature, the judiciary, and the executive __branch."__ he described the u.s. phone records collected under section 215 as basic information "just like what you would get in your own phone bill." "it is the number that was dialed from, the number that was dialed to, the date and the length of time. that's all we get," he said. "we do not get the identity of any of the parties to this phone call. we don't get any cell site or location information as to where any of these phones were located. and, most importantly, and you're probably going to hear this about 100 times today, we don't get any content under this. we don't listen in on anybody's calls under this program at all." tech companies jockey to seem the most transparent . instead, it takes permission from a special court to get access to further information, based on a verifiable link to a terrorism investigation, cole explained. such links have mostly come from another surveillance program that collects communications information of foreign terrorism suspects living overseas. critics question the need to store the vast amount of u.s. phone records, saying it creates a database prone to abuses and provides little return for the risk and privacy concerns. alexander said tuesday the phone database played a role in stopping 10 terrorist acts since the 9/11 attacks. at the same time, he and other officials said there were no cases they knew of in which anyone willfully misused the system to access information. "if you're looking for the needle in a __haystack,"__ cole said, "you have to have the __haystack."__

(cnn) -- the top government lawyers from three dozen states sent a letter to google on wednesday, expressing "strong concerns" with the privacy policy the web giant intends to roll out soon. "on a fundamental level, the policy appears to invade consumer privacy by automatically sharing personal information consumers input into one google product with all google products," reads the letter sent to google ceo larry page and signed by 36 state attorneys general. last month, google announced the new policy, which spells out how the company will collect and compile information to create a profile of users based on their activity across all of its various sites and tools. that includes google search, __gmail,__ the google+ social site and phones running its android operating system. privacy advocates objected to the policy -- which is set to go into effect march 1. eight members of congress, both democrats and republicans, wrote their own letter to page, asking for clarification about the changes. in wednesday's letter, the state attorneys called the policy __"troubling__ for a number of reasons," saying that users should be able to use one product without having its information shared with others. __"consumers__ have diverse interests and concerns, and may want the information in their web history to be kept separate from the information they exchange via __gmail,"__ they said. __"likewise,__ consumers may be comfortable with google knowing their search queries but not with it knowing their whereabouts, yet the new privacy policy appears to give them no choice in the matter, further invading their privacy." google said wednesday it's willing to discuss the policy with government officials, but that its intention is to make using its products easier and more transparent. "our updated privacy policy will make our privacy practices easier to understand, and it reflects our desire to create a seamless experience for our __signed-in__ __users,"__ a google spokesman said in a written statement. "we've undertaken the most extensive notification effort in google's history, and we're continuing to offer choice and control over how people use our services services. of course we are happy to discuss this approach with regulators __globally."__ in a blog post when the policy was announced, google's betsy __masiello__ noted that many of google's products, including youtube and search, don't require users to be signed in to use them. other tools allow for __"incognito"__ modes and there are other privacy tools that can be used, she said. a later post from google public policy director pablo chavez said that the company's privacy policies, but not its privacy controls, are changing. they are "trying to make them simpler and more understandable, which is something that lawmakers and regulators have asked technology companies to do," he wrote. "by folding more than 60 __product-specific__ privacy policies into our main google one, we're explaining our privacy commitments to users of those products in 85% fewer words." that wasn't enough for the attorneys general. they singled out users of android phones, which make up about 50% of the u.s. smartphone market, saying they won't be able to __"opt__ out" without buying a new phone. "no doubt many of these consumers bought an __android-powered__ phone in reliance on google's existing privacy policy, which touted to these consumers that 'we will not reduce your rights under this privacy policy without your explicit __consent,'__ " the letter said. "that promise appears not to be honored by the new privacy policy." the letter asks google to meet with representatives of the attorneys general before the policy goes into effect "to work toward a solution that will best protect the privacy needs of those who use google's products."

(cnn) -- the u.s. olympic committee says it is too late to remake uniforms that sport "made in china" labels for the london games, though vowed team usa would march in clothing made in america during the opening of the 2014 winter games. the announcement friday was an about face by the __usoc__ a day after it defended the use of the ralph lauren designer uniform, which were widely condemned by lawmakers who questioned why the work was not given to the hard-hit american textile industry. "we take seriously the concerns we've heard from members of congress and the american public regarding the u.s. olympic team's opening and closing ceremonies __uniforms,"__ scott __blackmun,__ the __usoc__ chief executive officer, said in a written statement. "with athletes having already arrived in london, and the apparel distribution process beginning this weekend, we are unfortunately not able to make a change for london. we are absolutely committed, however, to working with our sponsors to ensure that the concerns voiced are __addressed."__ what's really __'made__ in __america'__ in the statement, __blackmun__ said that ralph lauren would domestically manufacture the uniforms to be worn at the opening and closing of the winter games in sochi, russia, in two years. ralph __lauren's__ sponsorship as the official __outfitter__ of the u.s. olympic team began in 2008 and runs through 2020, according to __usoc__ profiles of its sponsors. the controversy cast a spotlight on the plight of the u.s. textile industry, which has been hit hard in recent years by outsourcing and the economic downturn. __"ralph__ lauren promises to lead the conversation within our industry and our government addressing the issue of increasing manufacturing in the united states and has committed to producing the opening and closing ceremony team usa uniforms in the united states that will be worn for the 2014 olympic games," the fashion company said in statement released friday. according to the u.s. labor department, 10 years ago, there were more than 350,000 americans employed by apparel manufacturers. last month, that number was __147,300.__ in testimony before congress last year, the american apparel and footwear association said that 98% of all apparel and 99% of all footwear sold in the united states are manufactured abroad. the news the uniforms were made in china broke the same week house democrats introduced a "make it in america" jobs bill, striking a raw nerve with some lawmakers. senate majority leader harry reid, d-nevada, said the __usoc__ "should be __ashamed"__ and called for the uniforms to be __"burned."__ initially, __usoc__ spokesman patrick sandusky took to twitter to describe the uproar as __"nonsense."__ in a statement on thursday, he said: "unlike most olympic teams around the world, the u.s. olympic team is privately funded and we're grateful for the support of our __sponsors."__ public pressure, though, mounted with thousands taking to facebook and twitter to demand the uniforms be made in america. the first indication the __usoc__ was changing its position came early friday when rep. steve israel and sen. kirsten __gillibrand,__ both democrats from new york, said they spoke with __blackmun.__ from our __readers:__ forget uniforms, u.s. olympians should 'go __naked'__ the two lawmakers wrote a joint letter on thursday to the __usoc__ urging it to make the uniforms in the united states. "just had a positive conversation __re:__ uniforms with ceo of the __@usolympic__ committee. looking forward to hearing more soon," israel said in a tweet. a short time later, the __usoc__ and ralph lauren issued statements. israel said he happy to hear the olympic committee will require future uniforms be domestically manufactured "but disappointed no __us-made__ uniforms in london," he tweeted. __dara__ torres, a former american olympic swimmer who won 12 medals in a span of 20 years, said the ralph lauren uniforms -- with their blue __berets__ and __blazers__ and __off-white__ pants and skirts -- looked great but would be better if they were produced domestically. __"wearing__ the u.s. uniform, going out there to represent the united states, it would be nice if it was actually made in the united states," she told cnn. the __usoc__ is no stranger to controversy over its __sponsorships,__ with questions being raised over why it opted last year to extend bp's sponsorship through the 2016 rio de janeiro games, following the gulf of mexico oil spill in 2010. it was questioned as early as the 2002 during the winter games in salt lake city about why american athletes donned __berets__ made by roots, a canadian company. headlines also were made this year in australia when it was revealed its uniforms for the olympics also were made in china. the australian olympic committee responded to critics by saying it was not financially viable to make the outfits at home, according to local media reports. some canadian lawmakers became irate in 2008, when it was learned that canadian uniforms for the olympics in beijing were made in china. american companies have made olympic uniforms in the past, notably, __reebok,__ __levi's__ and champion. for 2014, team usa uniforms will be made in america .

washington (cnn) -- the worst oil spill in u.s. history has heated up the debate about how to feed the nation with cleaner, safer energy. the argument over whether to __"drill__ baby __drill"__ -- the 2008 gop campaign mantra -- returned in april after a deadly oil rig blast spilled millions of gallons of oil into the gulf of mexico. the disaster threatened jobs in the nation's seafood and tourism industries and hundreds of miles of sensitive __wetlands,__ marshes and wildlife. the spill came as president obama was backing expanded offshore oil drilling and as congress considered wide-ranging energy legislation aimed at cutting pollution and u.s. dependency on foreign oil. before bp's gulf oil disaster, obama's late march proposal called for opening swaths of u.s. coastal waters in the atlantic ocean and the gulf of mexico to oil and natural gas drilling. after the spill, obama said offshore drilling is key to "our energy future," but it can move forward only with assurances that the gulf disaster won't be repeated. the president halted drilling permits for new wells and ordered inspections of all deepwater operations. former gop vice presidential nominee and alaska gov. sarah palin -- who in 2008 called on the u.s. to __"drill__ baby __drill"__ in the protected arctic national wildlife refuge -- tweeted that obama should offset his drilling moratorium by __"correspondingly"__ allowing "more onshore drilling, including __anwr__ reserves. domestic __oil's__ still required in us industry." will the spill change obama's oil policy? senate democrats gave up on their goal of passing a __slimmed-down__ energy bill before august recess. senate majority leader harry reid blamed unified republican opposition to the proposal. ____ ____ "it's a sad day when you can't find a handful of republicans to support a bill that would create 70,000 __clean-energy__ jobs, hold bp accountable, and look at a future as it relates to what bp did." republicans pointed at reid. "sen. reid is predictably blaming republicans for standing in the way of a bill that he threw together in secret and without input from almost any other member of the senate," said sen. lisa murkowski of alaska, the top republican on the energy committee. __"process__ alone guaranteed its failure, although substance would have as well had sen. reid actually brought his bill up for debate or a vote." the democratic bill had been stripped of its most controversial components such as limits on carbon emissions. the remaining legislation would have eliminated a __$75-million__ cap on economic damages that offshore oil __drillers__ would be responsible for. it would have reformed federal government oversight of offshore drilling. it encouraged the use of natural gas engines in commercial __trucks;__ and it promoted high efficiency appliances in homes. republicans planned to offer an alternative bill that included lifting the obama administration's blanket moratorium on deepwater drilling, setting up a bipartisan commission with subpoena power to investigate the gulf oil disaster and propose reforms, and allowing for revenue sharing for states that permit offshore drilling. an energy bill passed last year by the house of representatives included a controversial __cap-and-trade__ system. the system would set a price for greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide, and __polluters__ would obtain and trade credits for emissions over a set threshold. ____ ____ republicans and oil and coal producers oppose such a plan. supporters say it's the best way to begin reducing u.s. dependence on fossil fuels. would a nuclear power comeback be a good thing? obama has been a key figure in energy talks among lawmakers. ____ ____ in late june, he met with a bipartisan group of senators at the white house to discuss passing an energy and climate change bill this year. ____ ____ the president had expressed hope that something could be done. ____ "there was agreement on the sense of urgency required to move forward with legislation, and the president is confident that we will be able to get something done this year," the white house said in a statement. obama told senators that he believed the best way to make a transition to a __clean-energy__ economy is with a bill that "makes clean energy the profitable kind of energy for america's businesses by putting a price on __pollution,"__ the statement said. cnn congressional producer ted barrett contributed to this report.

the massive hurricane __barreling__ toward the east coast has both presidential campaigns throwing out their __fourth-quarter__ __playbooks,__ canceling events in the storm's track and attempting to balance last-minute intensity with a show of compassion for people whose lives could be __upended.__ on sunday, __politicos__ from both sides said it was still too early to tell how the storm would affect the race, but that access to voting centers would be a concern if effects from the storm persist until election day. "i don't think anybody really __knows,"__ top obama adviser david axelrod said on cnn's "state of the union" about the potential political impact of hurricane sandy. "obviously, we want unfettered access to the polls because we believe that the more people come out, the better we're going to do, and so to the extent that it makes it harder, you know, that's a source of concern. but i don't know how all the politics will sort out." live blog: hurricane sandy . virginia's republican governor said sunday his state would take measures to ensure residents are able to vote, despite potential obstacles brought on by the storm. "we'll be ready, but we're planning for __contingencies__ if there's still a problem," bob mcdonnell said on "state of the union." he said his state would "absolutely" make polling centers such as schools and fire stations a top priority for restoring power should widespread outages occur. another __virginian,__ democratic sen. mark warner, predicted on fox news the __"storm__ will throw havoc into the race." obama, romney campaigns cancel events ahead of hurricane . in virginia, the effects of a major storm could linger until election day. hundreds of thousands of customers in northern virginia lost power for more than week after hurricane irene in august 2011 and again in june after a powerful complex of thunderstorms called a __derecho__ moved through. residents' priorities might still be dealing with the storm's aftermath rather than a trip to the polls. virginia offers early absentee voting only with an __excuse,__ unlike other states that offer less restrictive ways to cast ballots before november 6. that means the race in the commonwealth will be won or lost on election day. north carolina and maryland, two other states in the storm's projected path, offer in-person early voting, which has benefited democrats in the past. martin o'malley, maryland's democratic governor, canceled early voting on monday in his state. in delaware, new york, massachusetts, connecticut and rhode island, residents only have the option of voting early by mail. hurricane __sandy:__ 5 things to know . sen. john mccain, r-arizona, predicted sunday the storm could help boost obama in the eyes of voters, but said he doubted the image of a strong leader would sway voters after months of campaigning. "i think that the president of the united states is the commander in __chief,"__ mccain said on cbs. "the american people look to him, and i'm sure he will conduct himself and play his leadership role in a fine fashion. so i would imagine that might help him a little bit. but i'm not sure it will affect votes. ____ people have been exposed to this very long campaign." obama is being briefed regularly on the storm's path, white house officials say, and he will balance his campaign with his responsibilities as president. "this is an example yet again of the president having to put his responsibilities as commander in chief and as leader of the country first while at the same time he pursues his responsibilities as candidate for election," white house spokesman josh earnest said friday. in a statement sunday at the headquarters of the federal emergency management agency, obama warned americans in the storm's path to prepare. "this is a serious and big storm," obama said at __fema,__ adding "you need to take this seriously and take guidance from state and local officials." obama advises preparedness ahead of storm . while obama will balance governing and campaigning this week, romney will also face the task of adopting the right tone during a time of crisis for a large chunk of the east coast. a top republican conceded even __"weather-safe"__ swing states such as colorado and ohio might be difficult campaign stops for romney if hurricane sandy __devastates__ the eastern seaboard with widespread injuries, deaths or life-threatening situations. disasters, natural and otherwise, are always a difficult balancing act for politicians of all stripes who don't want to be seen as __uncaring,__ even if there is little for them to do. "it gets __tricky,"__ the source __conceded.__ __"optics__ are important." that source said the romney campaign will "play it by __ear"__ as the storm __unfolds.__ romney campaign spokesman kevin madden said sunday afternoon that campaign workers in virginia "are doing as much as they can to help with relief efforts." the former massachusetts governor and the president have already canceled stops in virginia, a pivotal swing state expected to be hard hit. vice president joe biden canceled a saturday event in virginia and one scheduled for monday in new hampshire. both campaigns cited a desire not to use resources better targeted toward __pre-storm__ __preparations.__ __crowley:__ sandy introduces big unknown into campaign . ann romney, who was slated to campaign in new hampshire on monday, canceled her events, and the romney campaign said the bus that was to be used for her visit would instead be deployed for __"relief__ efforts throughout the east __coast."__ both campaigns said they were suspending fundraising e-mails to supporters in virginia, pennsylvania, north carolina, new jersey and the district of columbia. obama canceled trips to the battlegrounds of ohio and colorado to stay in washington and monitor the oncoming storm, though a campaign trip to florida remained on the president's schedule for monday. romney is scheduled to campaign in ohio, iowa and wisconsin on monday, then in ohio on tuesday. a romney campaign stop scheduled for tuesday in new hampshire was canceled late sunday afternoon, the campaign announced in an __e-mai.__ opinion: how sandy will test obama, romney . madden said the campaign would continue to update romney's calendar, based on where the storm goes. "the schedule we have locked down for now are in states that are not directly impacted by the storm," he said. "but, again, we're going to continue to update it. we're going to continue to monitor the situation and stay in close contact with folks that are in the states that have the best information." this is the second time the campaign has been affected by a major weather event. hurricane isaac forced the cancellation of the first day of the republican national convention in tampa, florida, in august. asked whether the romney campaign felt __snake-bitten__ by mother nature, madden said, "well, there's certain things we can't control and nature's one of them. so we just try to have focus on what we can control and part of what we can control is making sure that safety is a priority for the people that are in harm's way in some of these states that are going to be directly impacted and so that's a top concern and it'll remain a top concern." while the political experts navigated the ramifications of the storm, at least one campaign had more practical matters in mind. tim __kaine,__ the democratic senate candidate in virginia, e-mailed supporters to ask them to take their yard signs down during the storm, lest they become __projectiles.__

(cnn) -- the top government lawyers from three dozen states sent a letter to google on wednesday, expressing "strong concerns" with the privacy policy the web giant intends to roll out soon. "on a fundamental level, the policy appears to invade consumer privacy by automatically sharing personal information consumers input into one google product with all google products," reads the letter sent to google ceo larry page and signed by 36 state attorneys general. last month, google announced the new policy, which spells out how the company will collect and compile information to create a profile of users based on their activity across all of its various sites and tools. that includes google search, __gmail,__ the google+ social site and phones running its android operating system. privacy advocates objected to the policy -- which is set to go into effect march 1. eight members of congress, both democrats and republicans, wrote their own letter to page, asking for clarification about the changes. in wednesday's letter, the state attorneys called the policy __"troubling__ for a number of reasons," saying that users should be able to use one product without having its information shared with others. __"consumers__ have diverse interests and concerns, and may want the information in their web history to be kept separate from the information they exchange via __gmail,"__ they said. __"likewise,__ consumers may be comfortable with google knowing their search queries but not with it knowing their whereabouts, yet the new privacy policy appears to give them no choice in the matter, further invading their privacy." google said wednesday it's willing to discuss the policy with government officials, but that its intention is to make using its products easier and more transparent. "our updated privacy policy will make our privacy practices easier to understand, and it reflects our desire to create a seamless experience for our __signed-in__ __users,"__ a google spokesman said in a written statement. "we've undertaken the most extensive notification effort in google's history, and we're continuing to offer choice and control over how people use our services services. of course we are happy to discuss this approach with regulators __globally."__ in a blog post when the policy was announced, google's betsy __masiello__ noted that many of google's products, including youtube and search, don't require users to be signed in to use them. other tools allow for __"incognito"__ modes and there are other privacy tools that can be used, she said. a later post from google public policy director pablo chavez said that the company's privacy policies, but not its privacy controls, are changing. they are "trying to make them simpler and more understandable, which is something that lawmakers and regulators have asked technology companies to do," he wrote. "by folding more than 60 __product-specific__ privacy policies into our main google one, we're explaining our privacy commitments to users of those products in 85% fewer words." that wasn't enough for the attorneys general. they singled out users of android phones, which make up about 50% of the u.s. smartphone market, saying they won't be able to __"opt__ out" without buying a new phone. "no doubt many of these consumers bought an __android-powered__ phone in reliance on google's existing privacy policy, which touted to these consumers that 'we will not reduce your rights under this privacy policy without your explicit __consent,'__ " the letter said. "that promise appears not to be honored by the new privacy policy." the letter asks google to meet with representatives of the attorneys general before the policy goes into effect "to work toward a solution that will best protect the privacy needs of those who use google's products."

__(cnn)isis__ is under pressure in parts of iraq and battling a variety of adversaries in syria, but it's __metastasizing__ at warp speed elsewhere, most dangerously in egypt and libya. it also has support in yemen, afghanistan and pakistan. and the leader of the group __ravaging__ northern nigeria, boko haram, has expressed his admiration of isis leader abu bakr __al-baghdadi.__ the savage killing of 21 egyptian christians in libya -- all of them dressed in isis' trademark orange prison garb -- is another indication of isis' ability to take advantage of collapsed or collapsing states and of its growing presence in north africa. most significantly, the atrocity took place in sirte, a long way from isis' first stronghold around __derna__ in the east of the country. isis' presence in sirte, a town of __50,000,__ has been growing. the egyptians were abducted in november, and more recently, the extremists strengthened their presence by taking over government buildings and a radio station. isis first announced itself in libya in october. amateur video showed a large crowd of militants in __derna__ affiliated with the shura council for the youth of islam chanting their allegiance to __al-baghdadi.__ sources told cnn at the time that isis had up to 800 fighters in the area as well as training facilities in the nearby green mountains. they were bolstered by the return from syria and iraq of up to 300 libyan jihadists. a short while later, al-baghdadi recognized three libyan __"provinces":__ __barqa__ (in the __east),__ __tripolitania__ __(west)__ and __fezzan__ __(south)__ as being part of the __"caliphate."__ since then, isis has stepped up its presence across libya. late last month, a suicide bombing and gun attack on a hotel in the capital, tripoli, killed 10 people, including an american. the attack was swiftly claimed by __wilayat__ __al-tarabulus,__ isis' name for the province. politicians in tripoli disputed the claim. isis has also been active in southern libya, attacking a libyan army checkpoint in __sokhna__ in january and killing 16 people. while a growing presence, the libyan affiliate is some ways from being able to mimic isis in syria and iraq, with its bureaucracy and governing structure. geoff porter of north africa risk consulting says that "even in the jihadi stronghold of __derna,__ (isis) does not rule independent of a broader coalition of __like-minded,__ but ultimately distinct groups." "while isis may prove to be an enduring terrorist threat in libya, it is very unlikely to be able to develop to the point where it controls a meaningful amount of territory," porter says. but as in iraq and syria, isis has launched an effective social media campaign in libya. it has also made a concerted effort to attract seasoned fighters from other groups, such as ansar al sharia. isis libyan affiliate has also started to exercise some forms of social control in areas where it is strong. "the group has publicized __hisba__ activities such as burning cigarette __cartons;__ destroying water pipes used for __smoking;__ demolishing __"polytheistic"__ statues and __shrines,"__ says andrew __engel__ of the washington institute. hours after the egyptian air force carried out retaliatory airstrikes monday, the egyptian foreign ministry warned that __"leaving__ the situation as it is in libya without a firm intervention to curtail these terrorist organizations would be a threat to international peace and security." the italian government has suggested an international peacekeeping presence in libya. italy is acutely aware that it's the __jumping-off__ point for a growing flow of migrants and a base camp for terrorism, just hours across the mediterranean. bernardino leon, u.n. envoy to libya, has floated the idea of international monitors when a peace agreement between rival factions is hammered out. but __"when"__ seems a long way off, despite the beginning of talks between rival factions in geneva. and u.s. and european officials fear that putting boots on the ground would be a bug light to isis supporters. in a recent interview with the financial times, leon admitted that __"terrorism__ is becoming a problem beyond the east [of __libya.]__ it is growing into the west and now the south, and from the west they might go to tunisia and __algeria."__ porter agrees there is a risk to tunisia. there are hundreds of tunisians among isis' ranks in syria and iraq, and the government is already battling a jihadist presence at home in the __chaambi__ mountains. "although tunisian security services have improved their capabilities in the last 24 months, they fear that they would be overwhelmed by the emergence of a cross-border threat originating in libya," porter says. while libya is isis' most notable franchise, jihadists in egypt have made the vast sinai desert almost __ungovernable.__ chief among them is isis' freshly minted sinai province, formerly called ansar beit __al-maqdis.__ late in january, it killed at least 30 people in a series of __co-ordinated__ attacks on security __outposts,__ leading egyptian president abdel fattah al-sisi to shake up the military command in the sinai. and just last week, it released a video showing the beheading of eight alleged spies. with israel on one side and a __military-dominated__ government in cairo on the other, sinai province has powerful enemies close by. "that said," writes aaron __zelin,__ a leading scholar of jihadist movements, "if the egyptian government continues to operate in a brazen manner, militarily it will create new local recruits that could sustain the islamic state in north __sinai."__ less developed but worth monitoring are self-declared supporters of isis in pakistan and afghanistan, which the group now calls the province of __khorasan.__ one of them was a former taliban commander, mullah abdul __rauf,__ who was killed a week ago in a drone strike in helmand province. he had split from the taliban, and analysts are watching for further fragmentation of the group. several commanders of the pakistani taliban also pledged to al-baghdadi, but it's unclear yet whether their departure has more to do with the rifts that have torn the group apart in the last two years. the long war journal concluded that most of the new isis group were low- to mid-level militants -- a sign of "the competition between smaller and emerging militant groups in south asia, some of which are seeking to align with the islamic state __brand."__ within the group. the most intriguing development in recent months has been the desire of the nigerian group boko haram to fly the isis flag, literally and __metaphorically.__ it has begun to hold territory and talk of its own caliphate in northern nigeria. its propaganda machine has become much more __isis-like.__ and it has incorporated the isis symbol into its own flag. it has also begun inflicting ever more gruesome __punishments,__ including __beheadings,__ on its victims. boko haram's leader, abu bakr __shekau,__ has expressed his admiration for isis and al-baghdadi on more than one occasion -- but isis has not officially acknowledged any link between the two groups. for now at least, it is the long coast of libya and its deep empty interior, its lack of government and many porous borders that seem the most promising territory for isis.

los angeles (cnn) -- the estranged husband of "real housewives of beverly __hills"__ cast member taylor armstrong apparently killed himself in his home, according to police and the los angeles county coroner's office. russell armstrong's lawyer said he's "100% __convinced"__ armstrong's role in the reality show created his depression, but he does not blame the bravo network for his death. investigators did not find a suicide note near the body of armstrong, 47, who was pronounced dead at __8:16__ p.m. monday, assistant chief coroner ed winter said tuesday. his body was found in a __mulholland__ drive home in the hills above bel air, california, winter said. "it does appear to be a suicide by __hanging,"__ los angeles police spokesman richard french said. armstrong was the subject of numerous celebrity gossip website stories in recent weeks that detailed allegations of abuse made against him in his pending divorce. after taylor armstrong filed for divorce last month she told people magazine that she was verbally and physically abused during their nearly six-year marriage. "i felt like i was dying inside," she told people. "now, there's some sense of peace." in his interview with people, russell armstrong said, "maybe things happened in the heat of the moment, but it was during a time in our lives that was not characteristic of who we were. this show has literally pushed us to the __limit."__ ronald richards, who was russell armstrong's lawyer, said in an interview tuesday with a.j. hammer, host of hln's __"showbiz__ tonight," that the response to the divorce filing was sitting on his desk and had been about to be filed in court. "he did not want the divorce at all, but he was willing to accept her decision," richards said. "he tried to fix some of her concerns, but as i've advised many couples in this area, including mr. armstrong, these shows have a way of tearing apart a marriage when one spouse takes a certain directions and the other spouse is left kind of supporting the financial part of the marriage." armstrong, who was defending himself against a multimillion-dollar lawsuit, was financially __drained,__ richards said. his credit cards had been suspended, adding to the pressure, he said. but his downfall was caused by his role in the reality show, he said. "i'm 100% convinced and based on facts that this show led to his depression on a couple different __grounds,"__ richards said. "one is that the show characterized him as someone that abused his __spouse.__ it highlighted ancient financial negatives in his past and put him in a spotlight that he wasn't equipped to deal with." his lawyer said the allegations of verbal and physical abuse stemmed from __"drunk__ __arguments."__ "that's what they were dealing with here," he said. "there may have been the normal type of kind of shoving that drunk people sometimes get __into."__ a combination of factors stemming from the show were __"wearing__ on him," his lawyer said. "there's the appearance that she's moving forward as a __celebrity,"__ richards said. "he's now a divorce male with kids and he still has a tremendous debt service that he was handling for both of them that was supporting their __lifestyle."__ the sudden celebrity that followed the armstrong's appearance on "real __housewives"__ was overwhelming to the couple, he said. "when that sort of stardom attacks a marriage sort of overnight, like in the case of a reality tv star, it's not like an actor that progressively moves up the ladder and the couple deals with this in __stages,"__ he said. "a reality show takes an average person that has no stardom and throws them into a public spotlight literally within a couple of episodes, and a lot of couples are not prepared for that and this is a very unfortunate __consequence."__ still, richards said he does not blame the network for his client's depression and death. "a network cannot be held accountable to people's voluntarily opening of their doors of their private lives. the adults that allowed this to happen to them are responsible," the attorney said. "the network is justified in making good television out of their conflict." armstrong's death should serve as a warning to the dangers people face when they sign up for a reality show, he said. __"adults__ need to go into these things with your eyes wide open, __(realizing)__ that if you're going to have a network cover your private life, you become a public figure, people can comment about you and there's a high degree of probability that your marriage will end up in __shambles__ as a result of this newfound scrutiny by the public and by the tv network that is covering our private lives," richards said. the network that carries the show issued a short statement tuesday __morning:__ . "all of us at bravo are deeply saddened by this tragic news. our sympathy and thoughts are with the armstrong family at this difficult time." cnn's brittany kaplan and jack hannah contributed to this report.

(cnn) -- bahrain has foiled a foreign plot to destabilize it, the country's king said sunday. king hamad said the plot had been in the making for more than two decades -- but did not name a country that he believed was trying to carry it out. bahrain's sunni muslim monarchy has long suspected iran of attempting to foment unrest among the island's __majority-shiite__ population. relations have been tense in recent weeks as anti-government protesters have taken to the streets of __manama__ and iran has condemned bahrain's violent crackdown. the king was speaking to officers from the peninsula shield, the military arm of the gulf cooperation council. several members of the council have sent troops to bahrain to help __manama__ quell the protests. "an external plot has been __fomented__ for 20 to 30 years for the ground to be ripe for subversive __designs,"__ the king told the gathering. "such subversive designs are not however possible, whether in bahrain or in any other gcc country, thank __goodness,"__ he added, according to a report by the bahrain news agency. "i here announce the failure of the __fomented__ subversive __plot."__ king hamad said that if the plot succeeded in one council country, it could spill over into others. meanwhile, human rights watch urged bahrain on monday to end its __"campaign__ of __arrests"__ of doctors and human rights activists. over the weekend, security forces arrested four medical doctors and two activists, the group said. "the arrests, some of which occurred during pre-dawn hours, appear part of a broader government crackdown involving nighttime raids on the homes of those viewed as supporting pro-democracy __protesters,"__ human rights watch said. among those detained was __nabeel__ __rajab__ of the bahrain center for human rights. about 25 people in about a dozen cars pulled up to his house early sunday and took him to the offices of the interior ministry's investigative department, he said. "they said that they were looking for a suspect who was armed and thought i might know him," __rajab__ said. "they beat me, punched me, kicked me, handcuffed me. blindfolded me." the government confirmed that __rajab__ was arrested but did not provide additional details. in a statement released monday, the government denied accusations from the human rights watch suggesting "there is a campaign of indiscriminately arresting or targeting __doctors."__ "what such __organisations__ have so far failed to understand is that the services of some of bahrain's main medical facilities, including __salmaniya__ medical complex, had been overrun by political and sectarian activity," the government said in a statement. "this was totally unacceptable __behaviour,__ by any standard. "those responsible are being investigated and will be held to account in the __proper,__ legal manner." thousands of people have been demonstrating in bahrain since last month, part of a wave that has spread through north africa and the middle east. on saturday, u.s. secretary of state hillary clinton called on bahrain to allow its people to demonstrate peacefully as opposition members reported the death of a fifth __protester.__ "we have made clear that security alone cannot resolve the challenges facing __bahrain,"__ clinton said. "violence is not and cannot be the answer. a political process is. we have raised our concerns about the current measures directly with bahraini officials and will continue to do so." the demonstrators were killed when bahraini security forces cleared protesters from the pearl roundabout in the capital, __manama,__ on tuesday. the roundabout had been a rallying site for anti-government demonstrators since the unrest began. three days later, the government demolished the landmark monument at the center of the traffic circle.

(cnn) -- the fatal gang rape of a young woman in the indian capital of new delhi sparked weeks of angry protests and prompted heated debates about the __pervasiveness__ of sexual violence in indian society. cnn asked people in india and the indian diaspora for their thoughts on the case and the subsequent charges brought against six people, and also asked women for their personal experiences. responses ranged from anger at the system, which they feel failed the young woman who died, to recollections of the harassment they have suffered personally. "i have been __hooted__ at, i've been called names and told to dress __modestly,__ and let me remind you this is from people my own age and not older conservative people," said charity consultant __meera__ __vijayann__ from __bangalore.__ ireporter: rape __'still__ not seen as a human rights violation in __india'__ "this girl could have been me, it could have been any of my friends and no-one would have taken us seriously." proposals to install "fast track" courts for rape cases marked a promising start, she said, but she added that it would take more than just statutes to stop such __tragedies.__ violence against women in india is widespread. more than 220,000 incidents were reported in 2011 alone, according to indian government statistics. human rights activists point out that, due to under reporting, the real figure is most likely much higher. but it's not just the statistics -- it's the __mindset,__ many indians said. following the attack, there was further outrage when the indian president's son, __abhijeet__ __mukherjee,__ dismissed women who had flocked to the streets to protest against the case as __"dented__ and __painted,"__ comments for which he later apologized. read more: the perils of being a woman in india . such __victim-blaming,__ they said, must stop. "there is a sexist __mindset,__ politicians have made silly remarks about women and how they should wear modest clothes, not go to parties," __vijayann__ said. "if they make the laws how will it benefit us? people have to change the way they think." despite such comments making headlines, many indian men were quick to express their outrage at the attack. __akash__ __bhattacharya,__ a software engineer from __bangalore,__ attended some of the protests and candlelight vigils that erupted in indian cities after reports of the case emerged in local media. he said he had felt __"ashamed"__ as a man to hear the news and called for a shift in attitudes towards women and how they are treated. ireporter: 'i'm ashamed as a man in my own __country'__ __"harsher__ punishment will stop a case here and there, but that will not change our mind set," he said. "when will our conscience __overpower__ our __instincts?"__ __siddharth__ __katragadda,__ an artist and writer from india now living in san diego, california, said that for the first time in india's history, "we're realizing that we cannot protect our women by hiding them behind tradition and values." india, he said, was experiencing a __schism__ between a value system that relied on shutting women away to one where external forces such as the police and the criminal justice system were looked to for support and justice. "for centuries, india protected its women against such crimes by hiding __[them]__ behind strict rules of personal fashion and even stricter __traditions,"__ he said. "now, urban indians look -- as the west does -- to its laws and policing to protect its women. what we're seeing is clash of those opposing __cultures."__ more: __'india__ has woken up and realized that change is __needed'__ nonetheless, he was also quick to point out that india is far from the only country with endemic sexual violence. __"rapes__ are crimes of opportunity that occur in every corner of the world, not just india," he said. five of the suspects were formally charged on thursday with the murder, rape and kidnapping in a new delhi court, senior police officials said, while another is awaiting age tests to determine if he is old enough to be tried in an adult court. several of the charges carry the death penalty if they are convicted. there are hopes amongst indians that the potent mix of public anger, political nervousness and global pressure may impress on authorities the need for action to prevent such crimes happening again. the sheer horror of the case has also increased calls from some protesters for use of the death penalty, which is legal but rarely used in india. images of angry demonstrators carrying mock __hangman's__ __nooses__ and signs calling for the suspects to be killed have left little doubt that there are some in india keen for this sentence to be carried out if the men are convicted. others, however, were more __circumspect,__ citing sanctity for life, or the possibility of rehabilitation or change. "i believe rape is the most grave crime as the victims die two times, once physically and one emotionally, so the __[suspects]__ must be given severe punishment __[if__ __convicted]__ which can make them realize how painful it is," said __dorjay__ __namgail__ from __chandigarh,__ northern india, on facebook. "but i think we should abandon capital punishment. every human being has the capacity [to] transform themselves into a good, law abiding citizen." more: remembering the new delhi gang rape victim . the sheer tragedy of the case has also prompted some outside of india to take action, from sharing thoughts and condolences on social media to organizing vigils in honor of the unnamed victim. __reena__ __combo,__ a media specialist living in birmingham, england, whose family comes from new delhi, decided to organize a vigil after her tweets about the case sparked an outpouring of emotional responses and pleas to take action.

new delhi (cnn) -- on a recent trip home to india, i heard a german man on my flight remark to another passenger that he'd taken his son on a tour of a kolkata __slum.__ i believe the man was well-intentioned -- he wanted his child, accustomed to a comfortable existence, to get a firsthand look at how millions of poor people live. later, i discovered that slum tours in india are often organized and can cost money. reality tours and travel takes tourists on slum and sightseeing tours in mumbai. a walking tour of __dharavi,__ asia's largest __slum,__ costs only __$9.__ for about __$135,__ five people get a __nine-hour__ car tour of __dharavi,__ the red light district of __kamathipura,__ as well as other more traditional tourist areas. reality tours founders say the tours were set up __"primarily__ to show the positive side of the slums and break down negative stereotypes about its people and __residents"__ who occupy cramped huts in __unending__ stretches of __squalor.__ they say 80% of their profits go back to local communities through social service programs. that seems like a noble cause, but then i got to thinking about the idea of poverty tours in general -- how it might feel to be a __slum-dweller__ coming face to face with a wealthy visitor __gawking__ at me as though i were an animal in a zoo. therein lies the debate over such tours. kennedy __odede,__ the executive director of shining hope for communities, a social services organization in kenya, decried poverty tours of nairobi's largest __slum,__ __kibera.__ he wrote in the new york times that the tours do nothing to alleviate the problem. __"slum__ tourism turns poverty into entertainment, something that can be momentarily experienced and then escaped from," he said. "people think they've really __'seen'__ something -- and then go back to their lives and leave me, my family and my community right where we were before." i decided to see for myself. when i was in new delhi over the winter, i signed up for a walking tour in __paharganj,__ a neighborhood near the train station that i had always known as __seedy.__ i'd rushed through it once before in my life, when i had to spend a night after a train was delayed. it's not unlike the many neighborhoods in kolkata i know so well. the smell of __turmeric__ and green __chiles__ mixing with that of garbage and __urine.__ it's a __hodgepodge__ of activity. women cooking. men working. children sleeping out in the open, a swarm of flies covering their __unwashed__ faces. a maze of __snaking__ __alleyways__ and dark, __dank__ corners. and people everywhere, entire families crowded into small rooms, sleeping on one bed. these were sights and sounds familiar to me, and i always considered myself immensely lucky to have lived outside of that world -- lucky, at least, to live in relative comfort. i was curious to see how tour operators presented indian poverty, especially to foreigners. i picked one run by a nonprofit organization that works to improve the lives of street kids. this way, my money was going toward a good cause. "this is unlike other poverty __tours,"__ says __poonam__ sharma, coordinator of the tours. "when people start interacting with the children, misconceptions about street life fall away." i am asked to meet the guide from salaam __baalak__ trust at 10 a.m. salaam means hello and __baalak__ means child. the tours are conducted by former street kids who were able to improve their lives through the organization. on this day, i am among a handful of people, all foreigners on the city tour. our guide is a young man named __iqbal,__ who has been living on the streets since he ran away from home at 5. "can you guess why a child runs away from __home?"__ he asks us. __"poverty,__ abuse, addiction. and sometimes, they think if they come to the city, they can become a bollywood star." the tourists laugh. iqbal continues and tells his own story. "my parents used to fight," he says. "my father beat me." so he ran away to the streets of new delhi. he spent nights __terrified,__ alone and hungry on trains and in stations. he was beaten and abused, he says, by other street dwellers and even by the police. most of the boys work __menial__ jobs or __steal,__ he tells us. they are deft __pickpocketers.__ girls, he says, run away because their parents cannot afford __dowries__ to get them married, and they don't want to be a burden to their families anymore. instead, they come to the city and sell their bodies to eat. the street kids have nowhere to keep their money. they spend whatever they __earn,__ or it's stolen while they sleep. iqbal used to work at a recycling center. out of every 100 rupees __($2.25)__ he __earned,__ 75 went to the gangs who provided security. after that, he worked at a chai __(tea)__ stall and then at a __dhaba__ __(roadside__ __eatery),__ where he didn't get paid but got something even __better:__ food and shelter. iqbal leads us from the main road into a lane. he shows us a recycling shop, like the one where he worked, where newspaper and glass bottles turn into money. we wander through the main market in __paharganj,__ assaulted by a __panoply__ of goods -- __handbags,__ __sweaters,__ pots and __pans,__ pirated cds and dvds, refurbished electronics, blankets, shoes. he takes us to one of salaam __baalak__ __trust's__ shelters next to the bustling train station. we learn a bit of history from him. "in __1911,__ delhi became the capital of india," iqbal says __proudly.__ "more than 400,000 people pass through this train station every day." upstairs from a small police station is a shelter where children can come to rest, eat and get medical attention. boys of all ages were hanging out that day, glued to a television set. __"normally,__ kids don't trust you," iqbal says. "it is quite difficult to convince them to come to a __shelter."__ dr. vijay kumar sits behind a stark wooden table with a giant __logbook__ in front of him. he says he treats kids for all sorts of ailments and regularly administers hiv tests. many children fall into a life of addiction. they sniff glue or burn foil and smoke __gecko__ __tails.__ next, we make our way to the salaam __baalak__ trust office in __paharganj,__ passing by a pottery market, where __merchants,__ mostly women, are selling their __terracotta__ __wares.__ the tourists in my group are __wide-eyed.__ they peer down alleys where you can only walk single file. they smile at people who pass us. photography is forbidden on many parts of the tour. nor do we stop to speak to any of the residents. we climb up several flights of stairs at the office. a wall of success stories greets the tourists. sonia works for designer __ritu__ __kumar.__ __nitish__ works for the delhi __metro.__ and there's __iqbal,__ who eventually made his way to one of salaam __baalak__ __trust's__ shelters and __straightened__ out his life. he studied computers and dreams of becoming a software engineer. not surprising, i think, for a kid who grew up during india's information technology boom. iqbal is 20 now and has not seen his family since that day that he decided to run. he cannot even remember where he was from. "maybe up," he says, referring to neighboring uttar pradesh state. he takes us into one of the classrooms. the younger children at salaam __baalak__ trust perform for the tourists. they sing their hearts out; their smiles are wide. they seem so innocent, like children at my neighborhood __day-care__ center in atlanta. but they have seen the worst of life. they can never grow up with the sweet __naivety__ that makes childhood __carefree.__ __caitlyn__ __oleykowski,__ a student at the university of pittsburgh, says the city tour is __eye-opening.__ she came to india to see places such as the taj __mahal,__ and although she encountered __beggars__ on the street, she never would have walked through __paharganj__ by herself. she tells me she has not seen poverty like this before. through her travels in india, she felt __helpless,__ not knowing whether or how to help. university of illinois student ruth __tekeste__ says she feels inspired by the street kids. others in the group also tell me that this is an india they might not have otherwise seen. and maybe they were wiser for it, __sensitized__ to problems that can be unimaginable back home. how can that be __bad?__ there's no better way to learn about a place, after all, than to experience it. still, as the foreigners turn in their donations for salaam __baalak__ trust, i can't help but think about the day for what it was: a tour of poverty. and __hasty,__ i think. in all of less than two hours, our look at others' lives is over. the only people i have spoken to are connected to salaam __baalak__ trust and provide a very positive outlook on things. what might __paharganj__ residents have told us? we all head back to where we first met iqbal and scatter in our taxis and auto __rickshaws.__ we escape the slums and return to comfort, leaving iqbal and thousands of other __baalaks__ on the streets. i think about __iqbal's__ parting words. he feels lucky most of the time, though sometimes, he can't shed the melancholy that blankets him. that's something that visitors cannot see on the tour. what do you think about the idea of poverty __tourism?__ share your thoughts in the comments section below.

london, england (cnn) -- as airlines slash flights and cut spending in the wake of rising fuel prices, rail travel across europe is entering into a period of __renewal.__ eurostar launched services from its new london station, st __pancras__ international in november 2007. by 2010, the continent's rail operators expect 25 million passengers to be using its high-speed networks, up from around 14 million today. and this staggering growth is expected to spill into the next decade. this week, network rail, the owner and operator of britain's rail infrastructure, has commissioned a study that could lead to the biggest overhaul of the nation's rail industry since the 19th century. the study will consider five new __intercity__ lines running north and west of london. new lines, built alongside existing tracks, could accommodate high-speed trains similar to france's __tgv__ that travels at 186 miles per hour __(300__ __km/h).__ if approved, journey times between london and manchester could be slashed to just over one hour, and two hours between london and __glasgow.__ the cost of such expansion is large, says a network rail spokesperson, but crucial to absorb the nation's increasing demand for rail travel. despite complaints over overcrowding and affordability of rail travel in britain, passenger numbers have soared by 40 percent to __1.13__ billion journeys a year in the last decade. and if growth continues as predicted, network rail expects many lines to be full by 2025. the popularity for rail is driven partly by a growing determination among passengers to become more environmentally friendly. a journey on high-speed train eurostar between london and paris generates one-tenth of the carbon dioxide produced by an equivalent flight, according to independent research commissioned by __eurostar.__ __rail's__ __city-center-to-city-centre__ service is also becoming an increasingly attractive alternative to flying. research has shown that business travelers are now willing to travel up to four hours on rail because of the increased productivity versus the airlines. leisure travelers are prepared to go further, using trains on journeys of up to six hours. if plans for new high-speed routes across britain are agreed, the earliest construction could begin is 2014, says network __rail.__ but expansion is already underway across the european rail network to handle growing passenger numbers. britain's first high-speed rail line was opened by eurostar last november. this links the new st. __pancras__ international station in central london with paris in just 2 hours 15 minutes and brussels in 1 hour 51 minutes. last june, __tgv__ __est__ opened in france, slashing journey times between paris and __reims__ to 45 minutes from 90 minutes, and from paris to __strasbourg__ in 2 hour 20 minutes instead of 4 hours. this line opens development of a __1,500-km__ european railway line intended to link paris and __bratislava__ via __strasbourg,__ __stuttgart,__ munich and vienna. other upcoming high-speed rail routes include the __hsl__ __zuid__ between __antwerp,__ belgium and __amsterdam;__ a number of alta __velocidad__ __espaÃ±ola__ __(ave)__ high-speed rail links between madrid and spain's provincial __cities;__ and a high-speed connection between spain and portugal. new high-speed lines are also expected in italy in early 2011. and if plans for a rail tunnel under the strait of gibraltar from spain to morocco are finalized, trains could link europe and africa by 2025. the efficiency of __trans-european__ rail travel will be further boosted following the formation of __railteam,__ an alliance of high-speed rail operators across western europe. these include deutsche __bahn__ from germany, __sncf__ in france, eurostar as well as operators from netherlands, austria, switzerland and belgium. at the moment making connections, for example between a eurostar service from london to paris and then to a __tgv__ across france or an ice high-speed train through germany can be complicated. the new alliance, that works like a __code-sharing__ airline alliance, means travelers can book tickets on a __multilingual__ website to 100 cities, rising to 400 by 2020. the alliance will also cut waiting time between connections. and frequent business travelers will eventually be able to use a __'train__ __mile'__ program across the entire network. __railteam__ currently does not include operators in italy and spain where high-speed networks are less developed. but more train operators are expected to join in the future. what's more, legislation approved by the european union last year that requires national rail systems to open up to operators from other countries by 2010, will further push development of a european network of high-speed __rail.__ as this network __develops,__ and as appeal of air travel __falters,__ riding the rails between paris and __bratislava,__ or birmingham and brussels may not seem like such a bad idea after all.

"i'm sorry, but that's just a completely unacceptable statement in my opinion. for __(christie)__ -- a politician who's trusted and respected -- to make a statement that's categorically not true is just unacceptable and __appalling."__ what would mandatory quarantines do? "she's fine. she's not sick." hickox told crowley that mandatory quarantine is "not a sound public health decision" and that public health officials -- not politicians -- should be making the policies related to ebola and public safety. "for the first 12 hours, i was in shock. now i'm angry," she added. on sunday, __hickox's__ lawyers met with hickox at the hospital, saying they had a __75-minute__ conversation through a piece of clear plastic while she sat inside the tent. "she's fine. she's not sick," lawyer steven __hyman__ said in a sidewalk news conference aired on cnn affiliate wabc. "she went and did a __magnanimous__ thing and deserves to be treated with respect and dignity, not put in isolation because some political leaders decided it looks good to do that." lawyer norman __siegal,__ ____ former director of the new york civil liberties union, said he'll be filing papers in court for hickox to have a hearing no later than five days from the start of her confinement. he said the doctors at the hospital say there's no medical reason to hold her. the policy christie enacted is unconstitutional and too broad, he said. "we need to know what the medical facts are and not rely on politicians who have their own vested interests," he said. in a sunday evening news conference, new york city mayor bill de blasio commented briefly on __hickox's__ case, saying that "what happened to her was __inappropriate."__ "this hero was treated with disrespect and was not given a clear direction." "we owe her better than that, and all the people who do this work, better than that," he added. ebola gets political . 'to put me in prison is just __inhumane'__ hickox arrived in newark liberty airport on friday afternoon and after a seven-hour wait at the hospital. she was put in an isolation tent inside university hospital in __newark.__ she's twice tested negative for ebola, including a test at the centers for disease control in atlanta. hickox says she has asked repeatedly but hasn't been told how long she'll be held at the hospital. "to put me in prison," she said, "is just __inhumane."__ on sunday night, new york gov. andrew cuomo announced he was changing the state's mandatory 21-day quarantine policy for health workers who return from the ebola zone. people who worked with ebola patients but don't show symptoms of having the virus can serve their 21-day quarantine at home, the governor's office said. christie spokesman kevin roberts said late sunday night: "the protocol is clear that a new jersey resident with no symptoms, but who has come into contact with someone with ebola, such as a health care provider, would be subject to a mandatory quarantine order and quarantined at home. ____ __nonresidents__ would be transported to their homes if feasible and, if not, quarantined in new __jersey."__ on fox news sunday morning, christie said he had "no second __thoughts"__ about new jersey's mandatory quarantine for health care workers. "i believe that folks who want to take that step and are willing to volunteer also understand that it's in their interest and the public health interest to have a 21-day period thereafter if they've been directly exposed to people with the virus," he said. christie also told "fox news sunday" that a voluntary system of quarantine isn't __reliable.__ "i don't believe that when you're dealing with a serious situation like this that we can count on a voluntary system; this is the government's job." at a news conference saturday, the governor said, "i'm sorry if in any way she was __inconvenienced,__ but inconvenience that could occur from having folks that are symptomatic and ill out amongst the public is a much, much greater concern of mine. ____ i hope she recovers quickly." hickox said she has nothing to recover from. her temperature is normal, and she feels fine. "everyone keeps asking how i'm feeling physically and of course i'm fine physically, but i don't think most people understand what it's like to be alone in a tent and decisions are being made that don't make sense and show no __compassion,"__ hickox said, starting to cry. "i just feel like fear is winning right now, and when fear wins, everyone __loses."__ her life in quarantine . she's not allowed to have her luggage and was given paper __scrubs__ to wear. hickox said she has no shower, no __flushable__ toilet and the hospital gave her no television or any reading material. mostly, she says, she stares at the walls. on sunday afternoon, the hospital issued an update saying "the patient has computer access, use of her cell phone, reading material __(magazines,__ __newspaper)__ and requested and has received __take-out__ food and __drink."__ hickox said she's not allowed to see her lawyer or anyone else. "the tent has a window, and doctors talk to me in normal clothes from outside the window," she says. "so if there's no risk to them talking to me from outside the window, it doesn't make any sense that my lawyer wouldn't be able to do the same." a spokeswoman for the hospital said staff is trying to make hickox comfortable. "while we understand that the required quarantine is an __inconvenience,__ it is our primary goal to make sure the patient is as comfortable as possible. we have given our prompt attention to provide the patient with basic needs and to accommodate additional requests made by the patient," said __stacie__ newton, spokesperson for university hospital in __newark.__ would policy discourage health __workers?__ hickox said she worries that her experience will discourage other aid workers from going to west africa to help quell the ebola outbreak. that thought was echoed by dr. rick __sacra,__ an ebola survivor. he said he's afraid some returning healthcare workers will skirt the system and end up not being monitored . "you might have some renegade workers flying into toronto and then driving home and so they're not on anyone's __radar,"__ he said. "if quarantines push people away from transparent, friendly, __respectful,__ dialogue with public health workers, that may increase the risk back home." hickox said she would welcome christie to visit her in the hospital. "maybe he could tell me what __'obviously__ __ill'__ means. that would be great," she said. she added that she doesn't regret her trip to help ebola patients in africa. "someone asked me earlier would i do this again if i knew what would happen, and my answer is categorically yes," she said.

washington (cnn) -- president barack obama's final campaign isn't turning into much of a victory lap. his role in next week's midterm elections, which amount to the last important contest of his political career, has been to quietly rake in campaign cash for the democratic party, rather than headline the stadium rallies he became famous for in 2008 and 2012. the final week before the midterm elections is slated to be obama's __busiest,__ though the __eleventh-hour__ __politicking__ will only take the president to states that went his direction in 2008 and 2012. he'll campaign mostly for governors, whose role outside washington puts them further from the unpopular white house policies that give democratic senate candidates __heartburn.__ the __objective:__ turning out democrats who don't have a great record voting in midterm contests. his lone stop for a senate candidate comes in michigan on saturday for democrat gary peters, currently running ten points ahead of gop rival terri land. national republicans stopped spending ad money there weeks ago. obama's __truncated__ campaign schedule only reflects how big a drag the unpopular commander-in-chief is on his party's most vulnerable senate candidates. the electoral calendar has left democrats uniquely positioned to lose control of the upper chamber, a fact party insiders are already citing ahead of potential losses. related: key senate races in 2014 . related: cnn / __orc__ poll - voters are angry . in __republican-leaning__ states like louisiana and alaska, democrats are scrambling to keep seats amid __near-record__ lows in obama's approval ratings. democratic senators are working to convince swing __electorates__ that obama's policies aren't necessarily their own in north carolina, colorado and new hampshire. and in republican strongholds like georgia and kentucky, democratic candidates are quick to promise total independence from an unpopular white house. that leaves obama with few options to return to the campaign trail â his last opportunity as president. on tuesday he flew to wisconsin, where the republican gov. scott walker is virtually tied with his democratic challenger mary burke in a race that's focused largely on the state's economy. it's one of the nation's marquee governor's race -- one democrats desperately want to win -- and the highest-profile contest to feature a visit from obama. that burke, a former trek bicycle executive, doesn't have to answer for an __obama-aligned__ voting record makes a visit from the president __tenable.__ and with a statewide approval figure of __51%,__ according to a recent marquette survey, obama's in far better shape in wisconsin than he is nationwide. related: senate math seems impossible to some democrats . "the goal of the visit is to persuade the __once-every-four-year__ voters to vote this time," said __mortecai__ lee, a professor of governmental affairs at the university of __wisconsin-milwaukee.__ "in wisconsin politics, the higher the turnout, the more it __skews__ democratic. the lower the turnout, the more it __tilts__ gop. so this is __[burke's]__ effort to increase the size of the pie rather than fighting over the small remaining undecided slice of the current __pie."__ obama's other stops this week -- thursday in maine for democratic gubernatorial candidate mike __michaud,__ friday in rhode island for remarks targeting women voters, and sunday in connecticut for democratic gov. dan malloy -- are also meant to turn out democrats in states where he still remains somewhat popular. in maine, obama's objective will be to get democratic voters to "act like __democrats,"__ said brian __duff,__ a political science professor at the university of new england in maine, citing past elections there that have seen independent candidates shave away support from democrats. "in essence, this is a case where the question is less about matters of public policy, and more about energy and enthusiasm behind __michaud__ rather than the independent -- the democrats have built some but need to keep it up another week. the president's visit should help with that," __duff__ said. the same dynamic exists in connecticut, where obama hopes to help malloy pull ahead in a tied race with tom foley, a former u.s. ambassador to ireland. the president's only other campaign stops this cycle, on a single sunday this month in maryland and illinois, were both convened with the aim of turning out african-american voters in states already dyed blue. the white house, which says its main focus is on __combatting__ isis and stopping the spread of ebola, has said obama is __"psyched"__ for his return to the campaign trail, no matter how diminished his role. and they note that next week's results will be pinned to the president, no matter the outcome. "i feel confident predicting in advance is that the president will at least get some credit if democrats hold onto the majority in the senate and he'll get more than his fair share of the blame if they don't," press secretary josh earnest said monday.

(cnn) -- the top government lawyers from three dozen states sent a letter to google on wednesday, expressing "strong concerns" with the privacy policy the web giant intends to roll out soon. "on a fundamental level, the policy appears to invade consumer privacy by automatically sharing personal information consumers input into one google product with all google products," reads the letter sent to google ceo larry page and signed by 36 state attorneys general. last month, google announced the new policy, which spells out how the company will collect and compile information to create a profile of users based on their activity across all of its various sites and tools. that includes google search, __gmail,__ the google+ social site and phones running its android operating system. privacy advocates objected to the policy -- which is set to go into effect march 1. eight members of congress, both democrats and republicans, wrote their own letter to page, asking for clarification about the changes. in wednesday's letter, the state attorneys called the policy __"troubling__ for a number of reasons," saying that users should be able to use one product without having its information shared with others. __"consumers__ have diverse interests and concerns, and may want the information in their web history to be kept separate from the information they exchange via __gmail,"__ they said. __"likewise,__ consumers may be comfortable with google knowing their search queries but not with it knowing their whereabouts, yet the new privacy policy appears to give them no choice in the matter, further invading their privacy." google said wednesday it's willing to discuss the policy with government officials, but that its intention is to make using its products easier and more transparent. "our updated privacy policy will make our privacy practices easier to understand, and it reflects our desire to create a seamless experience for our __signed-in__ __users,"__ a google spokesman said in a written statement. "we've undertaken the most extensive notification effort in google's history, and we're continuing to offer choice and control over how people use our services services. of course we are happy to discuss this approach with regulators __globally."__ in a blog post when the policy was announced, google's betsy __masiello__ noted that many of google's products, including youtube and search, don't require users to be signed in to use them. other tools allow for __"incognito"__ modes and there are other privacy tools that can be used, she said. a later post from google public policy director pablo chavez said that the company's privacy policies, but not its privacy controls, are changing. they are "trying to make them simpler and more understandable, which is something that lawmakers and regulators have asked technology companies to do," he wrote. "by folding more than 60 __product-specific__ privacy policies into our main google one, we're explaining our privacy commitments to users of those products in 85% fewer words." that wasn't enough for the attorneys general. they singled out users of android phones, which make up about 50% of the u.s. smartphone market, saying they won't be able to __"opt__ out" without buying a new phone. "no doubt many of these consumers bought an __android-powered__ phone in reliance on google's existing privacy policy, which touted to these consumers that 'we will not reduce your rights under this privacy policy without your explicit __consent,'__ " the letter said. "that promise appears not to be honored by the new privacy policy." the letter asks google to meet with representatives of the attorneys general before the policy goes into effect "to work toward a solution that will best protect the privacy needs of those who use google's products."

__bellefonte,__ pennsylvania (cnn) -- a jury of five men and seven women, along with four __alternates,__ was chosen wednesday in the trial of jerry sandusky, the former penn state assistant football coach charged with child rape. half of the 16 jurors and __alternates__ have ties to penn state, including one retired professor and one current professor, three graduates, two employees and one current student, showing the prominence of the university in the local community. sandusky, 68, has been under house arrest since being charged with sexually abusing 10 boys for at least 15 years. prosecutors say he met some of his accusers through second mile, a charity he created for underprivileged children. he has pleaded not guilty to the charges. sandusky jury __lockdown:__ risks vs. costs . letters written by sandusky to one of his alleged victims, identified only as victim 4, can be described as love letters, a source familiar with the case said wednesday. one letter describes love between a man and a boy, the source said. the letters are expected to be entered into evidence during the trial, two sources with knowledge of the case said. however, the letters, as first reported by abc news, may be given a different interpretation by the defense. they are expected to argue that the letters and notes that sandusky sent are benign and illustrate his love for the children he has helped over the years through second mile, according to a source familiar with the case who asked not to be named. victim __4's__ attorney, ben __andreozzi,__ said tuesday that he expects that letters from sandusky to his client will be introduced at the trial, but he declined to comment on their content. jerry sandusky's __'make-believe__ world' gifts that sandusky allegedly gave to victim 4, who is now 28, may also be introduced as evidence by prosecutors, according to a source close to the case. those gifts could include golf clubs and football __jerseys,__ a source said. a source close to another alleged victim, victim 1, said that victim 1 received birthday cards and notes from sandusky but that they were not sexually explicit in nature. they included statements such as "i love you" but did not contain anything overtly __sexual,__ that source said. joe __amendola,__ sandusky's attorney, asked judge john cleland for a __continuance__ wednesday, saying __andreozzi__ violated the court's gag order. cleland denied the request. before a gag order was imposed in april by the judge, a source close to the case told cnn's jason carroll the defense would argue the letters in question were not inappropriate. the source said sandusky wrote letters of encouragement over the years to dozens of young people. some were football players, or second mile participants, or other young people he tried to encourage to be better students. the source said these letters were not intended to bribe or to encourage anything sexual from the __recipients.__ the source also said sandusky would give gifts to encourage these boys to stay on track with their grades, attending class or taking part in charity functions. amendola told cnn's carroll in november 2011 that his client __"cared__ about a lot of kids." "and there are hundreds of other kids who jerry took to events and to whom he provided __gifts,"__ amendola said. "what we're saying is, that was __jerry."__ opening statements are expected to begin monday, cleland said, and the trial is likely to last about three weeks. the prospective jurors were quizzed tuesday and wednesday about their relationships with penn state, local law enforcement and second mile, and whether they had contributed to any of those entities. several reported knowing sandusky or his wife, and others said they had volunteered at second mile. the seated jury includes five members with children: three women and two men. some jury members said their jobs require them by law to report suspected sexual abuse cases. they range in age from early 20s to 70s and include a wal-mart worker, a high school teacher, a retired school bus driver and a student in his junior year at penn state who has ties to the football team and knows some witnesses in the case. prosecutors plan to call more than 50 witnesses during the trial, and the defense plans to call about 100, including jay and sue paterno, coach joe paterno's son and __widow;__ former graduate student mike __mcqueary;__ his father, __john;__ and former university president graham __spanier,__ among others. defense attorneys said wednesday their list will also include seven sandusky family members. authorities allege that sandusky abused some of the boys on the penn state campus. the case has shaken the university, raised questions about its response to the allegations and drawn criticism from those who claim penn state put its reputation ahead of protecting potential child victims. spanier and iconic head football coach paterno lost their jobs soon after sandusky's arrest amid criticism that they did not adequately handle the matter when allegations involving sandusky arose years earlier. paterno died of complications from lung cancer in january. __mcqueary,__ the former graduate student, is considered to be a key witness in the sandusky case. he has testified that he alerted paterno in 2002 that he'd seen what appeared to be sandusky sexually assaulting a boy in a shower in penn state's athletic facilities, an allegation that authorities didn't learn of until years later. paterno apparently told athletic director tim curley, but no one notified police. curley and gary schultz, penn state's senior vice president for finance and business, are now facing felony charges of perjury and failing to report the allegations to authorities. prosecutors said later that the mcqueary incident took place about a year earlier than was originally alleged, causing defense attorneys for curley and schultz to argue that one of the charges should now be dropped. both of them have pleaded not guilty, and their attorneys have said that prosecutors __"charged__ this case before (they) knew the facts." the prosecution is preparing witnesses for their testimony next week, several sources close to the case said tuesday. victim 4 is expected to testify first, with victim 1, who started the investigation by coming forward in 2008 and alleging years of abuse, to follow, the sources said. mcqueary and his father were told to be in town and ready to testify next wednesday or thursday, one of the sources said. cleland told members of the jury pool that jurors in the case will not be __sequestered,__ saying he will trust them not to read newspapers or follow the case online. as jury selection in the case began tuesday, penn state released a statement, saying, "the acts that jerry sandusky is accused of committing are horrible and if proven true, deserve punishment." the university said it would not comment on the specifics of the legal case but said it hopes that the trial __"provides__ answers we are all __seeking"__ and that "the legal process will start to bring closure to the alleged victims and families whose lives have been __irrevocably__ impacted and that they can begin the healing process." several of sandusky's alleged victims, including victim 4, asked a judge to protect their identities at trial. however, cleland ruled monday that the alleged victims' identities may not be concealed during the trial, although they will be protected through the jury selection process. cnn generally does not identify alleged victims of sexual assault. in interviews after his arrest, sandusky acknowledged showering and __"horsing__ around" with boys but denied being sexually attracted to them. cnn's susan candiotti, laura dolan, ross levitt and dana garrett, cnn contributor sara __ganim__ and __insession's__ lena __jakobsson__ contributed to this report.

it is nighttime as a pack of masked soldiers silently moves toward the front line of a deadly shootout between law enforcement officials and unknown men in a __dimly__ lit honduras neighborhood. but the soldiers are too late to prevent the grisly scene that awaits them. one of their own is on the ground, seriously wounded. one of the attackers is dead, and three others have been shot. "they didn't even say a word. they just pulled out their weapons and started shooting at our soldiers," army commander carlos __rolando__ __discua__ said of the scene, which has become all too familiar in __honduras'__ second-largest city. __discua__ oversees a unit of soldiers, often masked to protect their identities, who patrol the streets of san pedro __sula,__ the so-called murder capital of the world. photos: deadly violence grips honduras . for the second straight year, san pedro __sula,__ in northwest honduras, has topped a list of the world's 50 most violent cities, with a rate of 169 intentional homicides per 100,000 inhabitants -- an average of more than three people every day. the report, compiled by the mexican think tank citizen council for public security, justice and peace, compared intentional homicide statistics around the world in 2012. the report does not include cities in the middle east. the sunny beach resort of acapulco in mexico ranked second on the group's list, followed by the venezuelan capital of __caracas.__ new orleans is the murder capital of the united states, according to the report, which ranked the city 17th on the list. detroit, st. louis, baltimore and oakland were the other u.s. cities to make the list. central america's bloody drug problem . san pedro __sula's__ challenge, experts say, is that mexico's offensive against drug cartels and the active u.s. deportation of criminal immigrants are pushing the problem south. some of this criminal element has ended up in honduras, where, like most central american countries, law enforcement has few resources to fight it. but city residents say that __"murder__ capital of the world" is an __undeserved__ label that is hurting local businesses. there are only three __morgues__ in honduras, and one of them is in san pedro __sula.__ residents say that people who are murdered elsewhere and then taken to the city's morgue are being __grouped__ into the city's crime statistics. "all of the crimes that happen in northern honduras are registered as happening here," businessman luis __larach__ said. "so what we businessmen are doing is an accurate count to determine where crime or violent deaths originate so that the information is __truthful."__ the national autonomous university of honduras said that only people murdered in san pedro __sula__ were tallied in the group's report -- and that in fact the actual murder rate in the city is even higher. the authors of the report defended their research on the group's website, __writing:__ it "is not the ranking that damages the image of the city but the violence and the government's inability to contain and reduce it. to hide the problems never solves them." honduras is far from the only country in the region with a murder problem. the top 10 -- and 39 of 50 overall -- most violent cities on the list are latin american. authorities have launched operation lightning in san pedro __sula,__ __saturating__ violence hotspots with police and soldiers, and some residents believe the __beefed-up__ security is working. "there's more security now," said local resident __nicolle__ __valladares.__ "and that gives us peace." unfortunately, at least so far, the measures seem to have had little impact on the murder rate.

(cnn) -- you got to give the people, now . give the people what they want . -- the __o'jays__ . now that republicans have control of both houses of congress, they are going to have to do better -- and do right by all americans, not just their fringe conservative base. in the first days of the newly minted __112th__ congress, after the 2010 midterms gave republicans control of the house of representatives, the american people were clamoring for action on jobs and the economy. what did the new republican house give them? one of the first laws introduced was the no taxpayer funding for abortion act. whereas existing federal law already limited the use of government funds to pay for abortion, there were exceptions for incest and rape. the no taxpayer funding for abortion act attempted to narrow the definition of rape to only involving force. republican house speaker john boehner called the legislation a top priority for his caucus. maybe for conservative republicans but certainly not for most americans, especially when unemployment was 9% and the economy was still reeling from the great recession. then, as now, americans say the economy is the most important problem facing the country. even all the fear and __fear-mongering__ around isis and ebola hasn't changed this. people are far more worried about the economy and the job market. abortion barely registers as a concern in the polls. meanwhile, republicans have touted a list of "more than 30 jobs __bills"__ they have passed in the house but have failed in the democratic senate. the party has even printed the list on handy flash cards so that the likes of boehner can carry them in their pockets and wave around at political events. but those so-called __"jobs__ __bills"__ include repealing obamacare, __gutting__ clean air and water regulations, and weakening the national labor relations board. in other words, they're not really jobs bills but simply __fig__ leaves for __conservatives'__ long-standing ideological agenda. economists say the actual job growth impact of the gop agenda is next to zero -- not to mention the harm it will do to working americans who rely on wage standards and protections, or the 10 million-plus americans who have gained health insurance through obamacare. when republicans controlled just one house of congress, they perpetually and __annoyingly__ passed symbolic pet legislation that stood no chance of becoming law. now that republicans control both houses, that behavior won't just be irritating but downright __irresponsible.__ the american people have entrusted republicans with control of congress. they expect congress to lead, not continue to throw partisan temper __tantrums.__ __leading,__ in this context, means passing laws that solve real problems and are in forms that both parties agree on. no more __orwellian__ circus shows. for six years, republicans have condemned president barack obama and the democratic agenda. regardless of how the midterm results panned out due to a handful of races in red and __maroon-ish__ purple states, the fact remains that the democratic agenda is broadly and strongly supported. most americans support extending unemployment benefits, passing paid sick leave, lowering student loan rates and raising the minimum wage, as was reflected in ballot measure results across the country tuesday. it's why many of the republicans who won their races actually ran as rhetorical liberals, trying to mask their unpopular stances on women's issues and more. going into this election, while only 23% of americans have a "very __positive"__ view of obama and just 12% view the democratic party very __positively,__ the favorability percentage for the republican party is even lower -- just __7%,__ according to one survey. not exactly time to spike the football. of course, no party should govern based solely on popular referendum. that would be stupid. but governing without any concern for what the people want is insane. seven in 10 americans oppose limiting access to abortion, according to a recent poll. so why is it that in the past three years, state legislatures have passed more anti-abortion measures than in the entire previous __decade?__ the new republican leadership in congress should focus on issues such as rebuilding our crumbling bridges and other public infrastructure, or passing bipartisan immigration reform to help level wages and working standards for everyone in america. maybe there are even reasonable compromises to be found in reforming the tax code, making it simpler and more transparent while at the same time __fairer.__ either way, the gop should stop shutting down the government and blocking the president's appointments. sure, the american people blame both parties for gridlock. but when asked, they place more blame with republicans. now that they have full power in congress either to compromise or not with the white house, republicans have no more excuses. and if republicans don't start learning how to lead in a responsible, bipartisan fashion, the american people will have no more patience. in 1975 when the __o'jays__ sang "give the people what they want," they sang about the people wanting "better education now" and "better food to __eat"__ and "better __homing"__ (by which i assume they meant housing, not __pigeons).__ the __o'jays__ were singing about the real world -- real people and problems that political leaders should be __addressing.__ republicans have to stop singing their tired tune of __"criticize__ everything president obama __does"__ and instead starting singing harmony with the democrats to get things done in washington and, yes, "give the people what they want." we have real problems in america that need real solutions and real leaders doing the hard work of governing together. here's hoping republicans are up to the task to which they've been elected.

tokyo (cnn) -- japan's ministry of health, labor and welfare is investigating a report that workers at the damaged fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant were told to use lead covers in order to hide unsafe radiation levels, an official said. the alleged incident happened december 1, nine months after a major earthquake and tsunami ravaged northern japan and damaged the plant. "we'll firmly deal with the matter once the practice is confirmed to constitute a violation of any law," said the ministry official, who could not be named in line with policy. an official with the plant's operator, __tepco,__ said the company received a report of the alleged incident thursday from subcontractor tokyo energy & systems. the report said a second __subcontractor,__ __build-up,__ created the lead covers and ordered workers to use them over their __dosimeters,__ __pocket-size__ devices used to detect high radiation levels. the tepco official could also not be named in line with policy. tokyo energy & systems said in its report that the workers never used the covers, the tepco official said. japan's __asahi__ __shimbun__ newspaper, however, reported saturday that while some workers refused the orders to use the lead covers, nine others did use them for several hours. the newspaper's report cited plant workers, who described the lead covers as fitting __snugly__ over the __dosimeters__ inside the breast pockets of the workers' protection suits. tepco told cnn it ordered tokyo energy & systems inc. to conduct an investigation and is awaiting a reply. cnn's junko ogura contributed to this report.

nairobi, kenya (cnn) -- a month after an attack on kenya's westgate mall claimed at least 67 lives, leaked video footage from inside has sparked anger amid claims that it shows soldiers looting from stores as they hunted for the gunmen. the security camera footage shows kenyan army soldiers __striding__ through the __nakumatt__ department store, close to where one victim was shot to death hours earlier. read more: al-shabaab grew amid somalia's lawlessness . one soldier, and then another, __peels__ off to pick up objects from displays. it's impossible to see exactly what they take, but the footage -- leaked by police -- has fueled allegations by __storekeepers__ of army looting. __atul__ shah, managing director of __nakumatt__ holdings, told cnn it was impossible to tell exactly what, if anything, was taken from the store -- which held stock worth more than $16 million -- because it burned in the course of the four-day siege. "so i cannot say specifically anything was __looted,"__ he said, "but from the video i have seen -- yes, i saw some soldiers coming out with shopping bags. what was inside, what was there -- no, i cannot say." the video may be __inconclusive,__ but it still has shah asking questions. source: store in besieged kenyan mall run by attackers or associates . one piece of footage in particular shows a soldier entering a money exchange booth where shah said cash is usually kept. he can be seen __rummaging__ around inside and, as he leaves, he appears to put something in his pocket, though it's not clear what that is. shah also told cnn that a couple of cash registers that had survived the fire were found to have been forced open. no money remained inside. so far, he said, the army has told him nothing of what happened in his store. "let's hope allegations of looting and all that is not true, but if it is true ... we have a lot to think about our security forces," said __shah.__ __'great__ care and __attention'__ as kenya seeks to recover from an attack that shook the nation, the claims of looting have tinged the sadness many feel with anger. more than a week before the security video was released, kenya's ministry of defense issued a statement about the allegations. it said that securing the mall was an operation undertaken with other forces and that the army has a history of outstanding performance in operations inside and outside kenya. kenya mall attackers __prayed,__ talked on cell phone between shootings . the army soldiers took "great care and attention," as is necessary in a delicate hostage situation, it said. some of their own were also killed in the attack. "however, information is rife in the public domain that some of the __(kenya__ defense __forces)__ soldiers behaved __unprofessionally__ during the operation," the statement said. the ministry "is committed to get to the bottom of this," it said, and urged members of the public to come forward with information and evidence. __'unfortunate__ __incident'__ kenyan deputy president william __ruto__ acknowledged public anger over the alleged looting in a cnn interview. "i must admit that it's an unfortunate incident and the president has launched an inquiry to find out exactly what happened," he said. "that inquiry is under way, and we will take corrective measures to ensure that anybody and every person who participated in this mall incident, that may have overstepped their mandate, will be brought to book." bergen: al-shabaab backed by money from u.s. it will not be possible to say whether anyone is still missing at westgate mall until a forensic examination of the rubble is completed, he said.

los angeles, california (cnn) ____ -- the long lines of parked cars outside dodger stadium could have been the typical sign of an afternoon game featuring the boys in blue. but the massive crowd of cars at the stadium during the weekend had more to do with income than __infield__ plays. applicants wait their turn for an interview at the dodger stadium job fair on saturday. a two-day job fair to fill some 500 part-time jobs during the baseball season, from stadium security to hawking beer during the games, attracted nearly 7,000 applicants. while many are no doubt fans of the dodgers and would enjoy spending summer evenings at the __ballpark,__ all were eager to convert their summer time into cash. with the team in glendale, arizona, for spring training, the stadium became a human resources arena for six hours both saturday and sunday during the 2009 __dodgertown__ job fair. dodgers officials said they had expected as many as 10,000 applicants to show up during the weekend, based on similar job fairs held by other teams across the country as unemployment climbs and economic conditions worsen for many people. despite a lower turnout, this year's crowd was "significantly more" than similar job fairs in previous years, team officials said, although no numbers for previous years were released. joe walsh, vice president of human resources for the __dodgers,__ said he wasn't surprised by the uptick in applicant numbers, with the downturn in the economy.

"our country right now is not that aggressive when it comes to working with small, innovative, high-tech companies," __sancoff__ told cnn on the phone this week. "i love to pose the question: where are the __googles,__ the __microsofts,__ the __apples,__ in the defense __industry?"__ "a lot of times the reason why small companies don't venture into it is because the barriers of entry are so difficult." for its part, the pentagon says there's no official __"requirement"__ for __ghost.__ __translation:__ before the navy can contract to buy __juliet's__ __ghosts,__ war planners must tell congress it's necessary for the nation's defense plan. then the pentagon would have to persuade lawmakers to shell out tax dollars to buy it. the pentagon wouldn't comment to cnn specifically about __ghost.__ but cmdr. __thurraya__ kent, a spokeswoman for the assistant secretary of the navy for research, development and __acquisition,__ told cnn in an e-mail, "it's not procedure to procure a system without established __requirements."__ "that said, industry input is encouraged and assists the __[department__ of the __navy]__ with innovation and the pursuit of emerging __technologies,"__ kent wrote. __sancoff__ said his company is "in constant communications with the __navy,"__ but "it's very, very difficult to get through to the decision makers at the pentagon today." officials representing bahrain, qatar, saudi arabia and japan have engaged in "serious __discussions"__ about ghost with __juliet__ marine, __sancoff__ said. but so far, none have signed purchase contracts. it's unusual for a private contractor to build a __near-fully__ functional prototype naval vessel long before the pentagon has committed to a purchase. "we understood really early on that when you bring something this revolutionary to the government, it's not going to be readily accepted. we knew we had to prove the technology worked to even sell it." clearly, __sancoff__ is deeply committed to his company's project. and he has been since 2000, when 17 sailors died in yemen in the infamous attack on the navy destroyer uss cole. al qaeda terrorists in a small boat set off explosives near the cole, revealing the threat that small, high-speed boats pose to u.s warships near __coastlines.__ "that showed every terrorist you can take very few assets and very little money and you can just about sink a navy __destroyer,"__ __sancoff__ said. now 14 years later, __sancoff__ said such attacks remain among the navy's biggest threats. he's pushing ghost as a deterrent to protect thousands of sailors who he said are still in harm's way in the persian gulf. longtime washington-based defense policy expert john __pike,__ director of __globalsecurity.org__ told cnn, "it's hard to see what problem __[ghost]__ solves that hasn't already been solved several other ways." traditionally the navy __"hasn't__ had much use for such small __craft,"__ pike wrote to cnn via e-mail, __"apart__ from __inshore__ operations, since they generally don't operate well in the open ocean due to large __waves."__ ghost is incredibly stable in heavy seas, __sancoff__ said, thanks to a __gyroscope-stablized__ platform with sensors constantly monitoring and compensating for the rolling waves. "one of the obstacles that we've had to face," he said, "is that when you're introducing something so new as ghost -- something that hasn't been done before, thought of before, that flies completely differently than any other vessel -- it takes time for the government to be able to understand and to adapt to it." for generations it's been common for companies to take decades to develop and sell a successful weapons program to uncle __sam.__ "we set out to change that __paradigm,"__ he said. "this is much more like you'd see a high-tech start-up develop their business." that reminds __sancoff__ of another machine that the u.s. failed to embrace quickly. "the wright brothers tried to convince the secretary of war for years that an airplane was __viable,"__ __sancoff__ said, but, according to historians, "initial negotiations went __nowhere."__ and we all know what happened after that.

(cnn) -- call it "occupy facebook." or, perhaps, __"unoccupy__ facebook." hoping to capitalize on frustrations with the social networking giant, not to mention some of the __anti-corporate__ sentiment bubbling up on wall street and beyond, entrepreneurs have launched an upstart site called __unthink.__ the tampa, florida-based startup wants to be everything that facebook and rival google+ are not -- and it has the manifesto and __sassy__ youtube video to prove it. "i couldn't wait to tell my story. i couldn't believe that all this was free," says an actress in the video, __strutting__ through bohemian city streets in an __off-the-shoulder__ t-shirt with the words "wild and free" scrawled on it. "but i never knew that i'd be part of some damn puppet show -- that you thought you could own me. well, you can't own me!" later, she confronts a guy in a google+ t-shirt and another __hoodie-wearing__ character with a striking resemblance to facebook ceo mark __zuckerberg.__ the video is part of a series of __hype-building__ efforts, along with cryptic news releases promising a "secret project" and "social revolution," that preceded tuesday's limited launch. opened for __invite-only__ beta testing on tuesday, __unthink__ says it will offer an alternative to the privacy concerns some people have about using facebook or google's new rival network. facebook and google both collect information about users to tailor advertising to them. privacy concerns have cropped up over various features facebook has rolled out -- from mobile __check-ins__ to integration with other websites that can make a user's online behavior more public if settings aren't __tweaked.__ __unthink__ promises that, under its terms of use, all content will remain the property of the user. after signing up, an app lets users transfer photos and other info from facebook to the new site. "we worked hard for more than three years to research people's needs and present them with a solution that will empower them," __unthink__ ceo and founder natasha __dedis__ said on the company's website. "our mission is to __emancipate__ social media and unleash people's extraordinary potential. our -- not so covert -- mission is to spark a social revolution. we believe in people." __dedis__ said she had the idea for the site when her son wanted to join facebook and she read what she called the site's oppressive terms of use. according to __techcrunch,__ the site is __bankrolled__ with about $2.5 million in investments from venture __capitalists.__ and its business model for fighting the corporate social-media __giants?__ corporate __sponsorships.__ the site will let users either pick a participating business __(presumably__ one they __like)__ to __"sponsor"__ their page or pay a $2 annual fee for the service. through much of wednesday, after tech blogs began reporting on it, pulling up the __unthink__ site delivered an "over __capacity"__ message. __unthink__ isn't the first startup that has hoped to capitalize on __anti-facebook__ sentiment. last spring, diaspora raised $200,000 on __crowd-funding__ site kickstarter to develop a decentralized networking site. but more than a year and a half later, only an unfinished alpha version has been rolled out and, last month, developers sent out a plea for more money to people who have already signed up. the question, of course, is whether there's any appetite for yet another social networking platform in a landscape dominated by facebook, with its 800 million users, and to a lesser extent, twitter. even google has struggled to pull users away from facebook where, despite complaints, users have appeared willing to deal with occasional privacy concerns in return for a convenient online hangout populated by all their friends. but if even a small percentage of those users choose to abandon ship for the __"revolution,"__ it may be enough for __unthink__ to declare victory.

(cnn) -- with all sides vowing __politicking__ isn't in order, republican presidential nominee mitt romney got a close-up view friday of the devastation caused this week by hurricane isaac -- days ahead of a visit by his november __foe,__ president barack obama. romney went to louisiana's jefferson parish, __glimpsing__ the flooding and downed trees along with gov. bobby jindal and sen. david __vitter,__ both fellow republicans. the former massachusetts governor, accompanied by his wife, __ann,__ said the trip was "to learn and obviously to draw some attention to what's going __(on)__ __here...__ so that people around the country know that people down here need help." hours earlier, the white house announced that obama canceled a trip to cleveland and would instead head monday to louisiana. obama will meet officials dealing with __isaac's__ impact and "making sure that __unmet__ needs are being met and that the federal response led by fema is helping citizens in the affected areas and the state and local officials who are responding to the storm," white house press secretary jay carney said. the president on friday addressed the situation to start his speech to troops in fort __bliss,__ texas. he vowed the government will "keep doing everything that it can" to help those suffering due to the storm. "as a country, we stand united with our fellow americans in their time of need," obama said. jindal echoed that view, saying he was __"thrilled"__ both major party's presidential nominees were making time to visit his state. "there's no time for partisan politics in louisiana at this point in time," jindal said. mary landrieu, the democratic senator from louisiana, made a political point directed at romney during a news conference in plaquemines parish. she said she hopes the republican nominee will realize the importance of the army corps of engineers and its projects that tackle hurricanes and storm damage. she called the agency's budget __"underfunded."__ "two billion dollars is not nearly enough new investment in core infrastructure for our nation, so one of the things i hope __(romney)__ sees firsthand when he's here is that," she said. "i realize he's all about cutting the federal budget, but this is one agency that absolutely cannot take any additional __cuts,"__ she said. isaac made landfall on the seventh anniversary of hurricane katrina, which overwhelmed levees and contributed to nearly 1,800 deaths. after slamming into the united states as a category 1 hurricane on tuesday, isaac weakened considerably but still dumped ample rain as it headed north through arkansas and toward missouri. "there are some individuals in the metropolitan area of new orleans that have suffered damages in excess of what they suffered during __katrina,"__ said mayor mitch landrieu, where 20 inches of rain fell, according to the national weather service. with 25 mph sustained winds, the tropical depression moved friday night into the middle mississippi river valley, where it is expected to dump several more inches of rain, the national weather service said. by saturday night, it should start affecting the ohio river valley. already, isaac caused at least 19 deaths in haiti while churning north from the caribbean and into the gulf of mexico and then another four in louisiana and mississippi. it has also left its share of destruction and headaches, many of which persisted on friday. that includes hundreds of thousands without power around the gulf coast, including __430,000__ entergy louisiana customers friday evening. such such storm-related problems led the louisiana department of agriculture and forestry to offer up to 50 gallons of fuel per day for purchase by dairy farmers who were without power. the same department noted more than 160,000 gallons of diesel and __138,000__ gallons of __unleaded__ fuel had been requested by hospitals, law enforcement agencies and other emergency operators. floodwaters remained high, meanwhile, in numerous parishes where the lingering heavy rain combined with storm surges to __inundate__ scores homes and businesses. in plaquemines parish, for instance, officials intentionally breached a levee to help drain floodwater in nearby communities. the bodies of a man and woman were found in 7 feet of water in the kitchen of a home in the parish, officials said late thursday. an autopsy will determine the cause of the death for the couple, nungesser said. in st. __tammany__ parish, a __slidell__ resident was killed while driving through four feet of __floodwater,__ state police said. ascension parish announced voluntary evacuations for parts of the region. animals have also been impacted -- from the 94 cats and dogs in shelters in alexandria and another 63 in __haughton,__ to state authorities waiving restrictions to allow beef cattle to be evacuated from louisiana to texas. the storm had a "major impact" in mississippi, gov. phil bryant said. the state was among those soaked by the storm, including 17 inches in __kiln.__ a falling tree killed a tow truck driver in the state as he was attempting to clear debris on a road, officials said. water levels at __700-acre__ lake __tangipahoa__ dropped friday as authorities pumped water from it, meaning a damaged __earthen__ dam may not have to be __breached,__ mississippi emergency management spokesman brett carr said. "we don't know if it's going to be enough," said carr of the water level __drops.__ "we are clearing land in preparation for the __cut."__ residents living within a half-mile of the __tangipahoa__ river, which runs from the lake south into louisiana, remain under an evacuation order. officials in louisiana say two bridges in __tangipahoa__ parish have been closed because the river's water level has been too high. amid such continued challenges and the massive __clean-up,__ there were also signs friday of life returning to normal. days after closing off the __waterway,__ the coast guard captain at the new orleans port on friday reopened the mississippi river, from baton rouge to the mouth of the river, to limited vessel traffic. "although the mississippi river was heavily impacted by the storm, the navigational channel is in good condition. the coast guard is working with the maritime industry to respond to a number of ship __groundings__ and barge __strandings__ along the __riverbank__ caused by the river surge and high winds of the storm," the coast guard said. and louis armstrong new orleans international airport officials said friday that flights had resumed and commercial power had been restored. __terrebonne__ parish in louisiana announced, meanwhile, that its curfew had been lifted, its government offices reopened and its public transit system was back in operation -- though a boil water advisory remains in effect. jindal praised the selfless actions of people, like a caretaker who stayed behind to help nursing home patients despite losing homes during isaac and katrina. "i'm in awe of the generosity and resilience of the people," he said. cnn's brian todd and rich phillips contributed to this report.

san diego, california (cnn) -- when i speak to college students, i always push two __messages:__ if you work hard, take risks, leave your comfort zone and never give up, you can do anything you want to in life; and part of life is competition, because no matter what you want, you can bet that someone else wants it too. competition. a simple concept and a beneficial one. it makes us better by forcing us to work harder. sadly, it's also an idea that is going out of style in a society where students expect to get good grades just for showing up, where everyone gets a ribbon no matter where they finish, and where parents scheme to get their kids into college by lobbying state legislatures to create __set-asides__ for in-state residents at public universities. when we're not hiding from domestic competition, we're trying to shield ourselves from the foreign variety. __high-skilled__ workers don't want to compete with those from china, india or pakistan. __low-skilled__ workers are just as afraid of those from mexico, guatemala or el salvador. politicians only make matters worse. while republicans exploit the immigration issue, democrats do the same thing with trade. in last year's democratic presidential primary, barack obama and hillary clinton tried to give displaced workers in ohio, michigan and pennsylvania a convenient villain to blame -- the north american free trade agreement. both parties use lies and __demagoguery__ to exploit fears and convince frightened americans that we can fence ourselves off from competition. build a wall. impose a __tariff.__ all so we don't have to put up with the annoyance of being forced to __out-work,__ __out-produce__ and __out-hustle__ someone else to make a living. imagine that. what people in other countries accept as the natural order, we continue to __resist.__ what our own parents and grandparents came to expect decades ago when they went after a job, we think we're above. we've come to think that competition is cruel because there are winners and __losers;__ so we spend all our time devising new ways to minimize the losing. our elected officials should inspire us to be better people, and to learn to accept competition as part of life. instead, most of them are too busy telling us what we want to hear so we'll like them better and buy whatever they're selling at the moment. consider what rep. luis gutierrez, d-illinois, is __pitching.__ he has just written a new 10-point immigration reform bill that he plans to introduce any day now. in addition to providing a pathway to legalize 12 million illegal immigrants, gutierrez proposes to manage future immigrant flow by establishing a commission that ties foreign visas to labor market demand. "here's the guiding __principle,"__ gutierrez said on national public radio's "tell me more with michel __martin"__ in explaining the rationale for his bill. "no american worker, no citizen of the united states, no one born here in this country should ever have to lose an opportunity for __gainful__ employment at the expense of someone not born here." as principles go, that one is __dreadful.__ __gutierrez's__ bill has some good things in it, but it also has some things we could do without. a commission that protects american workers from competing with foreigners belongs in the second category. think about it. why should "no one born here in this country ... ever lose an opportunity for __gainful__ employment at the expense of someone not born here?" remember, these aren't illegal immigrants but legal immigrants coming on visas. why should u.s. citizens get a benefit not from education or hard work but from something they had nothing to do with -- where they were __born?__ if a job is available, u.s. workers should be free to compete for it, but not have it handed to them on a silver __platter.__ likewise, foreign workers who come here legally should have a shot at competing for that same job. of course, __protectionists__ claim that the playing field isn't level since foreign workers will often accept less money to do the same job, thus putting american workers at a __disadvantage.__ tough. president john kennedy had it right. at a press conference in march 1962, while fielding a question about military __reservists__ who were upset at being mobilized and deployed to europe and southeast asia, kennedy made the point that there is no level playing field -- not ever. "there is always __inequity__ in life," he said. "some men are killed in a war, and some men are wounded, and some men never leave the country, and some men are stationed in the __antarctic,__ and some are stationed in san francisco. it's very hard in military or in personal life to assure complete equality. life is __unfair."__ exactly. bad news, rep. __gutierrez.__ you're no jack kennedy. how sad that our current crop of elected leaders has strayed so far from such straight talk. instead, they __coddle__ us and make us comfortable with our fears ____ -- all so we'll keep __re-electing__ them. that way, they don't have to go into the private sector and compete for jobs with the rest of us. you see, our aversion to competition starts at the top. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of ruben navarrette jr.

(cnn) -- pinterest is the breakout social network of 2012, but even technology addicts could be excused for missing its rise to success. the web-based __"pinboard,"__ which launched almost two years ago, barely got a mention on silicon valley news sites until six months ago, when early adopters suddenly realized that a site with millions of monthly users had sprung up almost unnoticed by the tech press. that's because pinterest didn't take the usual route of web-based __startups:__ __romancing__ early adopters and technology journalists before attempting to __"cross__ the __chasm"__ to mainstream adoption. instead, pinterest grew a devoted base of users -- most of them female -- who enjoy __"pinning"__ items they find around the web. while clothing, home decor and recipes dominate the site, inspirational quotes and humor are also popular topics for users to add to their __pinboards.__ interest, meet __pinterest:__ site helps users catalog their passions . how successful is __pinterest?__ unique visitors to the site grew __400%__ from september to december 2011, and just last week one study showed that pinterest drives more visitors to third-party websites than google+, youtube and linkedin combined. demographics are surely a large part of __pinterest's__ __success:__ while __technology's__ early adopters have sprung upon other __interest-driven__ networks like __quora,__ these sites now suffer from a form of __"cumulative__ __disadvantage"__ in which mainstream users are put off by how __tech-centric__ they've become. __delicious,__ a __bookmarking__ service that hit it big during the __"web__ __2.0"__ era, __relaunched__ recently with a __pinterest-like__ interface, but has failed to attract the same audience. __canv.as,__ meanwhile, is a similar __pinboard__ concept, but caters mainly to those who keep up with the latest web memes and inside jokes. __pinterest,__ by contrast, provides no barrier to entry for anyone looking to __bookmark,__ share and comment on images and ideas from around the web. cnn ireport: what's your pinterest __passion?__ there's more to pinterest than its unique audience, however. if you'd mapped out the evolution of social sharing online a few years ago, you might have predicted that something like pinterest would emerge. as tech entrepreneur __elad__ gil __insightfully__ explained in an article on his blog last month, sharing on the web has been following three parallel trends. the first is that sharing involves less effort over time. the second is that social sites are becoming more visual over time. and the third is that __"people-centric"__ recommendations are being augmented by __"topic-centric"__ networks -- which is to say that while facebook lets you explore the web through information shared by friends, newer social networks organize content by topics of interest. some in the technology industry call this the __"interest__ __graph."__ social networks began with blogging tools like blogger and __wordpress,__ where you had to write an entire blog post to express yourself. then along came twitter and facebook, and a simple status update was all that was required to share a thought on the web. these sites then discovered even simpler ways to __share:__ __"retweeting"__ the updates of others and __"liking"__ web pages on facebook. tumblr, now one of the biggest blogging platforms, also fits the __trend:__ not only is it largely used to share images, but __"reblogging"__ the posts of others is a primary activity on the site. as for the trend toward organizing content by both topics and the stuff your friends __enjoy,__ you only need to look as far last year's hit news __app:__ __flipboard,__ which turns the news into a more visual experience on your ipad, __personalizing__ your experience by highlighting links shared by your online connections and topics you find interesting. pinterest checks all the __boxes:__ it's a visual social network that organizes images by topic and lets you __reshare__ with just one __click.__ so will we see a thousand pinterest __clones__ bloom, or will the site's stellar growth continue despite others jumping on the __trend?__ i'd say success is assured for __pinterest.__ thanks to the __"network__ __effects"__ of these sites -- you join because your friends are already there -- it'll becoming increasingly hard to compete with the new king, or perhaps queen, of social __bookmarking.__

(cnn) -- "the artist" beat out films from the likes of martin __scorsese,__ steven spielberg and george clooney to top honors at the academy awards on sunday -- not bad for a silent, black-and-white french film with no big-name stars. director michel __hazanavicius's__ love letter to old hollywood cinema was the undisputed king of the industry's biggest night, garnering five oscars for best picture, best __directing,__ best costume design, best original music score and best actor. but was the rise of "the artist" from contender to best picture winner -- the first silent film to win the award since __"wings"__ at the first academy awards in 1929 -- a triumph of marketing over __art?__ for many, the film's triumph at the oscars was a foregone conclusion, the result of a marketing process set in motion months ago by movie mogul harvey weinstein, who snapped up the u.s. distribution rights before anyone at the cannes film festival had a chance to __swoon__ over the french film last year. "there wasn't any doubt when it came to the top awards who the winners were going to be," total film deputy editor jamie graham told cnn. __"harvey__ is the best in the business at getting that awards attention, and it became clear with 'the __artist'__ two months ago that this was the film that had caught the __tailwind."__ the mercurial movie promoter and co-founder of __miramax__ films, credited for discovering "pulp __fiction"__ director quentin tarantino and a string of commercial and critical successes including "the english patient," __"shakespeare__ in love" and last year's "the king's speech," is famous for harnessing the momentum of his films at the right time and riding waves of publicity to wins at the podium and at the box office. no sooner had jean dujardin taken the top actor award for his portrayal of silent film star george __valentin__ at cannes than weinstein had the film's stars and directors hitting the award campaign circuit to capitalize on its surprise success. best actor winner dujardin walked red carpets around the world as other awards began to flood in. co-stars __berenice__ __bejo__ and john goodman plugged the film on cnn, and __uggie,__ the film's canine star, played dead and performed tricks from the film on major news channels on both sides of the atlantic. "people who don't play the game tend not to win at the __oscars,"__ said graham. "you really have to press the flesh and hit the road, and for the last three months their lives would've been dedicated to that." empire magazine's ian nathan says that by the time the golden globe award nominations came around, the race for oscar glory had narrowed to a __two-horse__ race between george clooney's "the __descendants"__ and "the artist" -- a race weinstein's relentless campaign strategy began to win by the end of last year. "something about what harvey managed to do -- getting these three very charming leads and the director out there, getting the dog out there, screening it to everyone who __mattered,__ __milking__ the nostalgia and old __hollywoodness__ of it -- lifted it from the competitor to the favorite long before the show came around," he told cnn. "once one film has a foothold -- once it's become the thing like 'the king's __speech'__ did last year -- then even clooney can't __compete,"__ he said. weinstein's strength, says __nathan,__ lies in his ability to catch a __"middle-brow"__ film right before it becomes popular and turn it into the __frontrunner.__ nathan told cnn: "he's very good at picking the __middle-brow__ __films...__ and the oscars are a mainstream event which celebrates the best of the middle. harvey's been a very __wily__ player in that, and you have to give him that credit, he knows how to map that out over a year." while "the artist" has punched above its weight at the box office, __tallying__ roughly __$76__ million in worldwide receipts so far __(58%__ from outside the __u.s.),__ the film didn't receive much of a box office bump following the announcement of oscar nominations in january, according to ian nathan -- especially compared with "the king's speech," which raked in an estimated __$415__ million worldwide __(66%__ from __international)__ on its way to winning best picture, actor and director at the 2011 academy awards. "it hasn't made the usual oscar success money that the 'the king's __speech'__ did last year," said __nathan.__ "it's a silent film with a french __sensibility,__ and it's a tougher sell for audiences. but now that it's got all the attention in the world, can that translate to more __money?"__ while the money may not follow, nathan says one thing seems certain -- after a relatively dry decade, the back-to-back successes of "the king's speech" and "the artist" means harvey weinstein is back in business. __"harvey's__ come out of his __fallow__ years as the guy to beat at the __oscars,"__ he said. "it's a bit of a second coming -- clearly he's still got a little bit of that __magic."__

(cnn) -- thousands of north carolina voters hit the polls on tuesday to cast their ballots on a referendum that would constitutionally ban same-sex marriage, even though state law already does not permit such unions. amendment 1 would alter the north carolina constitution to say that "marriage between one man and one woman is the only domestic legal union that shall be valid or recognized in this state." supporters argue that the amendment is needed to stop those trying to redefine marriage and to ward off possible future actions of __"activist__ __judges."__ it would also strengthen the state's position against same-sex civil unions, often considered a precursor to the marriage issue. opponents say the measure is redundant and could result in jeopardizing domestic violence protections for women and affect __couples'__ health benefits. follow all the political news at cnn.com's election center . several municipalities in north carolina provide benefits to same-sex couples, state officials say. duke university law professor kathryn bradley says those rights could be potentially lost if the referendum passes on tuesday. concerns over the measure also home in on the potential for unintended consequences, she said, affecting issues such as child custody and the prosecution of domestic violence among unmarried couples because of the narrow definition of the new statute. "before domestic violence laws, we relied on criminal assault laws, which don't always protect against things like __stalking,"__ added bradley, who says the measure could also affect heterosexual couples. but sen. dan __soucek,__ one of the primary sponsors of the proposed amendment, said he doesn't "believe those are legitimate concerns." "we looked at these issues extensively and tried to make sure that all of those concerns are __addressed,"__ he said. a simple majority is needed for the measure to be approved. it was passed in the state house and senate last year. both are __republican-controlled,__ the first time that's happened in north carolina in the past 140 years, according to house officials. "this bill's been 12 years in the __making,"__ noted maxine __eichner,__ a law professor at university of north carolina at chapel hill. "but it's now made possible because republicans control the __legislature."__ should amendment 1 gain approval, it would largely prevent the state's judiciary from overturning the bill by __enshrining__ its language into the state constitution. some 500,000 people had already cast ballots on the measure through early voting or absentee ballots. polls are set to close at 7:30 p.m. et. "it could destroy our family unit," said kelli evans alongside and her partner of 17 years, karen __wade.__ "if they could see that it's a family they're __affecting,__ maybe they could sit down and think about the issue before they vote on election day." others say the issue, if left __unchecked,__ could one day undermine traditional notions of marriage. evangelist billy graham endorsed the ballot initiative, a rare move for a preacher who has typically avoided political fights. graham took out full-page ads in 14 north carolina newspapers touting his support for the measure, saying "the bible is clear -- god's definition of marriage is between a man and a woman." graham's website encouraged churches to download a poster that bears his image and the message __"vote__ for marriage may __8th."__ on the other side, former president bill clinton opposed the amendment in a recording sent by phone to hundreds of thousands of north carolina homes. "so the real effect of the law is not to keep the traditional definition of marriage, you've already done that," clinton says in the recording. "the real effect of the law will be to hurt families and drive away jobs." the only recent public opinion polling on the issue, derived from a group that does work for democratic candidates and causes, indicates that a majority of north carolina voters support the amendment. nationally, according to a new gallup survey, 50% of americans believe same-sex couples should be allowed to __wed,__ a markedly different position than in past years, suggesting a growing acceptance of same-sex marriages. some 48% say they do not support same-sex __weddings.__ sen. __soucek__ described marriage on tuesday as a __"time-tested__ building block of society that revolves around __procreation."__ but three days earlier, vice president joe biden said he was "absolutely __comfortable"__ with the idea of same-sex marriage.

(cnn) -- rapid-fire tv news __bulletins__ or getting updates via social-networking tools such as twitter could numb our sense of morality and make us indifferent to human suffering, scientists say. scientists say updates on networking tools such as twitter are often too quick for the brain to fully __digest.__ new findings show that the streams of information provided by social networking sites are too fast for the brain's "moral __compass"__ to process and could harm young people's emotional development. before the brain can fully digest the anguish and suffering of a story, it is being bombarded by the next news bulletin or the latest twitter update, according to a university of southern california study. "if things are happening too fast, you may not ever fully experience emotions about other people's psychological states and that would have implications for your __morality,"__ said researcher mary helen __immordino-yang.__ the report, published next week in proceedings of the national academy of sciences online early edition, studied how volunteers responded to real-life stories chosen to stimulate admiration for virtue or skill, or compassion for physical or social pain. ireport.com: growing pains for twitter, __facebook?__ brain scans showed humans can process and respond very quickly to signs of physical pain in others, but took longer to show admiration or compassion. "for some kinds of thought, especially moral decision-making about other people's social and psychological situations, we need to allow for adequate time and __refection,"__ said __immordio-yang.__ she said the study raises questions about the emotional cost, particularly for young people, of heavy reliance on a torrent of news snippets delivered via tv and online feeds such as twitter. she said: "we need to understand how social experience shapes interactions between the body and mind, to produce citizens with a strong moral __compass."__ usc sociologist manuel __castells__ said the study raised more concerns over fast-moving tv than the online environment. "in a media culture in which violence and suffering becomes an endless show, be it in fiction or in __infotainment,__ indifference to the vision of human suffering gradually sets in." research leader antonio __damasio,__ director of __usc's__ brain and creativity institute, said the findings stressed the need for slower delivery of the news, and highlighted the importance of __slow-burn__ emotions like __admiration.__ __damasio__ cited the example of u.s. president barack obama, who says he was inspired by his father, to show how admiration can be key to cultural success. "we actually separate the good from the bad in great part thanks to the feeling of __admiration.__ it's a deep physiological reaction that's very important to define our humanity." twitter, which allows users to swap messages and links of __140-characters__ or less, says on its web site that it sees itself as a solution to information __overload,__ rather than a cause of it. this function, it says, __"means__ you can step in and out of the flow of information as it suits you and it never queues up with increasing demand of your attention."

behind a victorian shop front in the __cockney__ heartland of london's east end hides an urban agriculture initiative that claims to be the world's first farm in a shop. the __aptly-named__ __farm:shop__ sits along a busy main road next to a __ragtag__ bunch of more conventional retail outlets, most of which are in various phases of __decay.__ there are chickens grazing on the rooftop -- seemingly oblivious to the red double __decker__ buses roaring past below. inside are fish tanks filled with __tilapia;__ mushrooms __sprouting__ in the __basement;__ fruit blooming in a __polytunnel__ __greenhouse;__ and endless rows of herbs and salad leaves growing from the __hydroponic__ __troughs__ that line the shelves. "i think places like __farm:shop__ can reconnect people with their food," says engineer and co-founder paul __smyth.__ ____ "we've had this separation of countryside and city living ... so the connection has been severed between what you eat and how it's __grown."__ while the ethos is community focused, the __shop's__ interior is more like a laboratory than a local gardening center. ____ white __low-energy__ strip lights facilitate the growth of vegetables in lieu of sun __rays,__ and the cabbage patch looks more like a cluster of giant __petri__ dishes than an __allotment.__ "we've been learning as we go with most of this technology," admits __smyth.__ that said, the shop -- which opened in 2011 -- is already a modest commercial success. having diversified into a grocery store, cafe, __rentable__ office and events space, it now employs two staff and is turning a profit -- all of which is __ploughed__ back into the business. "we've experienced a great amount of goodwill and enthusiasm about the project. people just want to come off the street, learn how to raise a __fish;__ look after a __chicken;__ grow some food -- and that means you get a more __people-powered__ __agriculture,"__ says __smyth.__ __infographic:__ the secret life of drinking water . while few would contest the __rehabilitative__ social value of projects like __farm:shop,__ its founders argue it could be the start of something much more: a radical new approach to ecologically sustainable agriculture. "if you're growing food directly where it's __eaten,__ there's less __refrigeration__ ... less energy use through transport and __distribution,"__ claims __smyth.__ he says __farm:shop__ could be scaled up and replicated in cities around the world to help reduce the enormous carbon emissions linked to food production. it's a pressing issue. according to a 2008 greenpeace report, the food industry is responsible for creating 30% of the world's total annual carbon emissions. "the dominant food production system is based on fossil fuel at every level," says dr martin __caraher,__ professor of food and health policy at london's city university. "it needs oil to make the __fertilizer;__ oil for the __farm;__ oil for the food __processing;__ oil for the packaging and oil to transport it to the __shops,"__ he adds. among these stages, transport, processing and packaging account for the lion's share of __pollutants.__ the u.n. conference on trade and development __(unctad)__ estimates that between 65% to 85% of __food-related__ emissions in the western hemisphere is created once produce has left the farm. "this is why these type of projects are much more than feel-good __gimmicks,__ they are absolutely vital as part of a diverse array of sustainable agriculture systems that we must pursue further," says olivier de __schutter,__ the u.n.'s special rapporteur on the right to food. for de __schutter,__ the fact that food is often produced thousands of miles away from where most people live represents an irrational system, both from an __ecologic__ and economic perspective. __"rising__ fuel prices and the increasing concentration of the population in urban areas is bringing about serious logistical problems for the delivery of food," he says. __"traffic__ __congestion,__ high __refrigeration__ costs and, after all that, poor quality __produce."__ food destined for the uk alone travels 30 billion kilometers a year -- adding 19 million tonnes of co2 to the atmosphere -- according to international development agency practical action. it's also easy to overlook the damage inflicted on local ecosystems and economies -- a large portion of which are in the developing world -- as a consequence of current __industrial-scale__ agriculture practices. "the system is not working," says florence __egal,__ chairman of the food for cities network. "big __agribusiness__ __disrupts__ natural resource management with its demand for __monoculture__ crops, synthetic packaging and habitat contamination from factory __waste."__ read related: farm in the city could be supermarket of the future . both __egal__ and de __schutter__ agree that, even on a vastly escalated scale, initiatives like __farm:shop__ are unlikely to resolve the food sustainability issue by themselves. "right now, no-one is saying you're going to feed nine billion people like this," says __egal.__ "but agriculture reform is an incremental process requiring many solutions -- and growing __perishable,__ fresh produce near to where it's consumed seems like one very sensible step." back in east london, __smyth__ is optimistic about the future. __"farm:shop__ itself is __experimental,__ it will always be our laboratory at the heart of our ideas. but going forward we'll be looking at bigger sites, scaling up, growing more food and selling more food together -- and if we get those kind of sites we're really confident we can roll this out and make a real lasting difference."

dangerous place for many. some called for a boycott of these olympics, while others agreed that it would be for the athletes to take a stand once there. with the ukrainian situation, sochi has become even more political, but not for the reasons anticipated. while transgender italian activist vladimir __luxuria__ has been detained in olympic park for her flags and rainbow __attire,__ the athletes have mostly kept quiet. early on, pictures of __alexey__ __sobolev's__ __snowboard,__ adorned with the likeness of pussy riot, gave bob costas something political to talk about, while ski jumper daniela __iraschko-stolz,__ the first __"out"__ athlete to win a medal in sochi, expressed her disapproval of russia's anti-gay laws. this past week, snowboarder michael lambert also chimed in, __deeming__ russia a problematic host because it "has people suffer, shuts people up." he speculated that perhaps only scandinavia had the potential for a __"perfect"__ games. above all, through the scandals, conflicts and corruption, the ioc sees itself as a __peacemaker.__ but there are __inconsistencies.__ in 1968, it pressured the u.s. olympic committee to take action against sprinters __tommie__ smith and john carlos after the duo raised black __gloved__ fists during the victory ceremony of the men's 200-meter race to protest racial __oppression.__ four years later in munich, the ioc did not wait for the u.s. olympic committee to take action, banning u.s. sprinters wayne __collett__ and vince matthews for their __"disrespectful"__ behavior on the podium. in athens in 2004, the ioc failed to censure world champion iranian __judoka__ __arash__ __miresmaeili,__ who carried his country's flag in the parade of nations and then withdrew from competition after drawing an israeli opponent. yet it banned south africa in its apartheid era and afghanistan when the taliban took power, pressured saudi arabia to field female athletes and has long recognized teams from puerto rico and east __timor__ and palestinian territories as independent national __delegations.__ in sochi, ioc president thomas bach urged the ukrainians to demonstrate how __"sport__ can build bridges and help to bring people from different backgrounds together in peace." ioc member sergey __bubka,__ the great pole __vaulter__ who represented both the soviet union and his native ukraine in competition, echoed __bach's__ sentiments on twitter, urging his compatriots to remember the olympic truce and lay down their weapons. canada's globe and mail agreed, running the headline, __"shadow__ cast over sochi as ukraine violence __shatters__ olympic __truce."__ what is __confounding__ is the impression that until the most recent outbreak of violence in ukraine, the olympic truce was intact in these games. the ancient greeks invested in the olympics as a diplomatic tool, as the spirit of __ekecheiria__ stipulated laying down arms for athletic __competition;__ they used sport to interrupt the progression of war. with the relatively recent creation of the olympic truce centre, the ioc says it wants "to encourage searching for peaceful and diplomatic solutions to the conflicts around the world." black __armbands__ do not seem to fit within the __ioc's__ definition of peaceful and __diplomatic.__ and perhaps they will become unnecessary if the continuing violence can finally be __quelled.__ but that does not mean we are left with sports without politics. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of amy __bass.__

(cnn) -- with all sides vowing __politicking__ isn't in order, republican presidential nominee mitt romney got a close-up view friday of the devastation caused this week by hurricane isaac -- days ahead of a visit by his november __foe,__ president barack obama. romney went to louisiana's jefferson parish, __glimpsing__ the flooding and downed trees along with gov. bobby jindal and sen. david __vitter,__ both fellow republicans. the former massachusetts governor, accompanied by his wife, __ann,__ said the trip was "to learn and obviously to draw some attention to what's going __(on)__ __here...__ so that people around the country know that people down here need help." hours earlier, the white house announced that obama canceled a trip to cleveland and would instead head monday to louisiana. obama will meet officials dealing with __isaac's__ impact and "making sure that __unmet__ needs are being met and that the federal response led by fema is helping citizens in the affected areas and the state and local officials who are responding to the storm," white house press secretary jay carney said. the president on friday addressed the situation to start his speech to troops in fort __bliss,__ texas. he vowed the government will "keep doing everything that it can" to help those suffering due to the storm. "as a country, we stand united with our fellow americans in their time of need," obama said. jindal echoed that view, saying he was __"thrilled"__ both major party's presidential nominees were making time to visit his state. "there's no time for partisan politics in louisiana at this point in time," jindal said. mary landrieu, the democratic senator from louisiana, made a political point directed at romney during a news conference in plaquemines parish. she said she hopes the republican nominee will realize the importance of the army corps of engineers and its projects that tackle hurricanes and storm damage. she called the agency's budget __"underfunded."__ "two billion dollars is not nearly enough new investment in core infrastructure for our nation, so one of the things i hope __(romney)__ sees firsthand when he's here is that," she said. "i realize he's all about cutting the federal budget, but this is one agency that absolutely cannot take any additional __cuts,"__ she said. isaac made landfall on the seventh anniversary of hurricane katrina, which overwhelmed levees and contributed to nearly 1,800 deaths. after slamming into the united states as a category 1 hurricane on tuesday, isaac weakened considerably but still dumped ample rain as it headed north through arkansas and toward missouri. "there are some individuals in the metropolitan area of new orleans that have suffered damages in excess of what they suffered during __katrina,"__ said mayor mitch landrieu, where 20 inches of rain fell, according to the national weather service. with 25 mph sustained winds, the tropical depression moved friday night into the middle mississippi river valley, where it is expected to dump several more inches of rain, the national weather service said. by saturday night, it should start affecting the ohio river valley. already, isaac caused at least 19 deaths in haiti while churning north from the caribbean and into the gulf of mexico and then another four in louisiana and mississippi. it has also left its share of destruction and headaches, many of which persisted on friday. that includes hundreds of thousands without power around the gulf coast, including __430,000__ entergy louisiana customers friday evening. such such storm-related problems led the louisiana department of agriculture and forestry to offer up to 50 gallons of fuel per day for purchase by dairy farmers who were without power. the same department noted more than 160,000 gallons of diesel and __138,000__ gallons of __unleaded__ fuel had been requested by hospitals, law enforcement agencies and other emergency operators. floodwaters remained high, meanwhile, in numerous parishes where the lingering heavy rain combined with storm surges to __inundate__ scores homes and businesses. in plaquemines parish, for instance, officials intentionally breached a levee to help drain floodwater in nearby communities. the bodies of a man and woman were found in 7 feet of water in the kitchen of a home in the parish, officials said late thursday. an autopsy will determine the cause of the death for the couple, nungesser said. in st. __tammany__ parish, a __slidell__ resident was killed while driving through four feet of __floodwater,__ state police said. ascension parish announced voluntary evacuations for parts of the region. animals have also been impacted -- from the 94 cats and dogs in shelters in alexandria and another 63 in __haughton,__ to state authorities waiving restrictions to allow beef cattle to be evacuated from louisiana to texas. the storm had a "major impact" in mississippi, gov. phil bryant said. the state was among those soaked by the storm, including 17 inches in __kiln.__ a falling tree killed a tow truck driver in the state as he was attempting to clear debris on a road, officials said. water levels at __700-acre__ lake __tangipahoa__ dropped friday as authorities pumped water from it, meaning a damaged __earthen__ dam may not have to be __breached,__ mississippi emergency management spokesman brett carr said. "we don't know if it's going to be enough," said carr of the water level __drops.__ "we are clearing land in preparation for the __cut."__ residents living within a half-mile of the __tangipahoa__ river, which runs from the lake south into louisiana, remain under an evacuation order. officials in louisiana say two bridges in __tangipahoa__ parish have been closed because the river's water level has been too high. amid such continued challenges and the massive __clean-up,__ there were also signs friday of life returning to normal. days after closing off the __waterway,__ the coast guard captain at the new orleans port on friday reopened the mississippi river, from baton rouge to the mouth of the river, to limited vessel traffic. "although the mississippi river was heavily impacted by the storm, the navigational channel is in good condition. the coast guard is working with the maritime industry to respond to a number of ship __groundings__ and barge __strandings__ along the __riverbank__ caused by the river surge and high winds of the storm," the coast guard said. and louis armstrong new orleans international airport officials said friday that flights had resumed and commercial power had been restored. __terrebonne__ parish in louisiana announced, meanwhile, that its curfew had been lifted, its government offices reopened and its public transit system was back in operation -- though a boil water advisory remains in effect. jindal praised the selfless actions of people, like a caretaker who stayed behind to help nursing home patients despite losing homes during isaac and katrina. "i'm in awe of the generosity and resilience of the people," he said. cnn's brian todd and rich phillips contributed to this report.

(cnn) -- it started out as a simple concept. let people virtually grow gardens, raise farm animals and become farmers. it soon became a social media and gaming phenomenon. __"farmville"__ celebrates its fifth anniversary this summer. millions of players continue not only to harvest on a virtual landscape but also establish real-life relationships and support causes even as the game has plummeted from its unlikely peak at the top of the gaming world. once virtually impossible to avoid on the pages of facebook, __"farmville"__ goes against __gaming's__ standards. devoid of intense competition, it's a farming simulation game in which players plant crops, raise livestock and generally go about the business of living off the land. in its first six weeks in 2009, __"farmville"__ grew to more than 10 million players and became the most popular game on facebook. by the next year, its player base passed the 80 million mark, according to information collected by __appdata.__ by 2012, the game remained the site's seventh most popular game. charles london, senior creative director for __"farmville2,"__ said his team realizes that today's players are looking for a moment of peace and serenity in their gaming. he said he's thrilled how people are connecting through __"farmville."__ "their lives are increasingly __fragmented.__ they're overly __'technologied.'__ and they're separated from their community," london said. "in __'farmville,'__ they can get away from that. they can have a fantasy of a sweet, quiet, serene farm, and they can play with other players who really care about each other." despite criticism about the mindless nature of the game __(time__ magazine rated it one of the 50 worst inventions in __2010),__ 370 million virtual crops are harvested every day in __"farmville"__ and __"farmville__ 2," indicating players' dedication and involvement. as people moved to playing games on mobile phones, __"farmville"__ fell to 84th place in game rankings this year before __rebounding__ lately to __73rd,__ according to __appdata.__ but the millions who have stuck with it and its __sequels,__ __"farmville__ 2" and __"farmville__ 2: country __escape,"__ say these games have not only been fun to play but also give them a chance to connect in meaningful ways with others. sonya reynolds, 34, of morris township, new jersey, said the game helped her reconnect with a childhood friend who soon became her husband. "we could help out on each other's farms and also be able to catch up with the past many years," reynolds said. "since playing the game, i have built a chicken __coop__ with __phil,__ my husband, and bought __hens__ that i've __'owned'__ in __'farmville__ __2.'__ " according to a survey from __"farmville"__ maker __zynga,__ 80% of players say they've connected with people they otherwise wouldn't have through the game, and 34% play it with a significant other. other __"farmers"__ have stories about how the game has become an educational tool for children. melissa cunningham of __kingsland,__ texas, said she started playing because it reminded her of her grandmother's farm. but she discovered the game could help her son with __mathematics.__ "since playing __'farmville__ __2,'__ my son's math skills have drastically increased -- his grades improving from __cs__ to __a-/b+,"__ she said. "i love that he's learning through a game he enjoys without thinking of it as __'homework.'__ " london said his development team continually hears from players about what features they like or what they want to see in the future. he said the team wants to create features meaningful to players, including the ability to form virtual families. players can now create their own virtual __sweetheart,__ have a date, fall in love and get married in "my family __farm"__ for __"farmville__ 2." in the span of two weeks, zynga said __752,000__ players went on a "first __date"__ and 280,000 made a marriage proposal to their __in-game__ significant other. "what i love most about 'my family __farm'__ is it's so close to my life story as (my __husband)__ dean and i were childhood best friends," said __lynda__ jordan of __atascadero,__ california. "it's like watching us all over __again!__ it sounds funny for a game to change my life, but it really has." london said, "we're not in the business of explicitly getting people to fall in love. we are in the business of getting people to meet each other through play." the game and its players are also socially aware of causes and needs in real-life communities. in december, players raised $1 million for feeding america through a special game expansion called holiday lights, according to __zynga.__ players across the __"farmville"__ franchise have raised almost $8 million for charity in five years, it said. london said he's impressed by the social interactions taking place through the __"farmville"__ games.

baghdad, iraq (cnn) ____ -- gunmen broke into the house of a women's rights activist in the volatile northern iraqi city of kirkuk on thursday and beheaded her, police said. iraqi interior ministry troops conduct inspections at a checkpoint in the southern iraqi city of basra in may. the victim was identified as __nahla__ hussain, the leader of the women's league of the kurdish communist party. she was alone in the house at the time of her death. it is not known what the circumstances were that led to the attack. violence against women has been an ongoing problem in iraq. the killing comes ahead of next month's provincial elections, a __post-saddam__ era watershed event that's generating an uptick in civil unrest and political __infighting.__ twenty-four officers from the interior and defense ministries were arrested this week accused of facilitating the activities of former __baathist__ regime members, the iraqi prime minister's media spokesman said thursday. the arrests appear to have been politically motivated, a senior u.s. military official told cnn thursday. the official said prime minister nuri al-maliki is believed to be behind the arrests. iraqi interior ministry officials said the detained officers have links to the __al-awda__ party, an underground successor to saddam hussein's baath party, . the __baathist__ movement ruled iraq for 35 years but was banned after hussein was overthrown in the 2003 u.s.-led invasion of iraq. the arrests, which were made inside and outside ministerial offices, were carried out by an elite force that reports directly to al-maliki, according to an interior ministry official who spoke on condition of anonymity. al-maliki's media spokesman, __yasseen__ __majeed,__ denied that report and said the arrests were made by iraqi security forces acting on judicial arrest warrants. __majeed,__ al-maliki's military office, and maj. gen. qassim __atta,__ spokesman for the baghdad operations command told iraqi state tv that reports of a planned coup are incorrect. __majeed__ said the arrests were precautionary measures. he said investigations are continuing into the suspects, who are accused of facilitating the activities of "terrorists" and __"outlaws."__ initial reports listed arrest tolls that ranged from 20s to the 30s and said the arrested were all from the interior ministry, which oversees __policing,__ border enforcement and internal security. the ministry has been criticized by iraqi and u.s. officials for __inefficiency,__ corruption and infiltration by shiite militia groups during the sunni-shiite violence in 2006 and 2007. according to the interior ministry's spokesman, maj. gen. abdul karim __khalaf,__ the highest-ranking person taken into custody was a brigadier general, and the others were __low-ranking__ officers. he said 23 officers were detained and judicial authorities were questioning them. the interior ministry official who spoke on condition of anonymity said at least 32 ministry employees were arrested between monday and wednesday. that official had no information on the reasons behind the arrests. he said at least two generals were among the arrested, and identified one as gen. ahmed __taha__ abu __ragheef,__ head of the ministry's internal affairs department. __khalaf__ said __ragheef__ was not among those arrested, and __ragheef__ himself appeared on state tv to issue a denial. he said he took part in the investigation that led to the action. it is not yet clear how many sunnis and shiites were arrested in the case, but __saddamists__ tend to be sunnis. al-maliki is a shiite, and the government is dominated by a shiite bloc, called the united iraqi alliance, and a kurdish bloc. one knowledgeable iraqi politician told cnn he believes this and other discord at present in iraq, such as attacks, arrests and political __infighting,__ stems from internal conflicts between political parties ahead of the january 31 provincial elections. the voting -- to be held in 14 of iraq's 18 provinces -- has been much anticipated by u.s. and iraqi officials, who hope the election of local government officials can empower grass-roots iraqis and give alienated sunni arabs more political clout. sunnis, who had more power under saddam than they do now, feel they have been marginalized in iraq's new political system, where the majority shiite population and the kurds have emerged as powers. elections won't be held in __tameem__ province, where political disputes in the city of kirkuk have yet to be resolved, and in the three kurdish autonomous region provinces. as for the interior ministry, a september 2007 report assessing the status of iraq's security forces slammed it and the national police, which it __operates.__ the report by the independent commission on security forces in iraq, called interior "a ministry in name __only"__ and said it was __"widely__ regarded as being dysfunctional and __sectarian,__ and suffers from ineffective leadership." it said the national police force has been __"operationally__ __ineffective"__ and __"sectarianism__ in its units undermines its ability to provide __security;__ the force is not viable in its current form. the national police should be disbanded and __reorganized."__ the defense ministry oversees the military. the 2007 report had promising words for the iraqi army, special forces, navy and air force, describing them as "increasingly __effective"__ and __"capable__ of assuming greater responsibility for the internal security of iraq." cnn's jomana karadsheh contributed to this report.

(cnn) -- with the advent of __"cyberwar,"__ a poorly defined term that seems to be used as a __catch-all__ phrase for all manners of __computer-related__ attacks, it's natural to ask about cyber arms control. richard clarke, former cybersecurity adviser to president obama, has advocated along with others for cyber arms control or new legal rules for war in __cyberspace.__ if governments have the ability to build the tools of __cyberwarfare,__ then presumably, they can regulate and control them. but __realistically,__ it's unlikely that cyber arms control will happen anytime soon. when we think of arms control, we consider the efforts of the cold war, which dramatically cut the number of nuclear weapons and other strategic __armaments,__ from the period of __detente__ to the eventual collapse of the soviet union. arms control works fairly well for managing the arsenals of weapons that are large and complex. however, __cyberweapons__ are of a different league. all you need is training in computer software engineering and some talent. on the internet, there is readily available literature on coding and hacking, and of course, a plethora of open source tools. just as easy as it is to be an effective __cyberdefender,__ you can learn to be an effective offensive __cyber-operator.__ cyber attacks can be crafted and used by individuals or groups. importantly, they can make impact even without significant involvement from a nation. for example, the anonymous hacker group is able to disrupt major corporations and even countries with its campaigns for transparency. furthermore, when anonymous is unable to disrupt a target, it typically resorts to overtaking websites with massive denial of service attacks. despite the role of __nonstate__ players, it is the __brinkmanship__ between countries in cyberspace that make the big headlines. __mandiant,__ a cybersecurity company, reported a series of cyber attacks on u.s. companies that was traced to china's people's liberation army unit __61398__ based in shanghai. one of the lessons in the analysis is how remarkably effective the chinese attackers were despite a stunning lack of sophistication and __sloppiness__ in their __tradecraft.__ in contrast, our biggest and most innovative corporations have developed and deployed sophisticated defense systems that still seem to be regularly __breached,__ despite the efforts of their __comically__ inept __adversaries.__ if the chinese pla ever gets its act together, we're in real trouble. how might this get worse? we already know that __cyber-espionage__ can harm companies. the risks of __cybersabotage__ can be worse. for example, industrial control systems are largely computer controlled and they can be reached in some cases from the internet. future terrorist organizations could cause spectacular physical and economic damage to our __refineries,__ power plants, water systems, pipelines and other important systems without leaving a marked trail or suffering significant personal risk. in the wake of the __stuxnet__ attacks on iran's __uranium-refinement__ centrifuges or the __shamoon__ attack on saudi __aramco's__ computers, __cybersabotage__ can no longer be considered __theoretical.__ it is happening now. it's not difficult to imagine a future in which cyber attacks become more frequent or serious. in such a world, there will be a need for diplomacy and __norm-setting__ among the international community. but if we ever wanted to consider treaties on cyber __disarmament,__ or regulations on the use of hacking tools by those wishing to do more than simply spy or __steal,__ we would become immediately stymied by how to enforce the rules. barring a radical change in the technological playing field, there will never be an effective cyber equivalent of the international atomic energy agency despite all the aspirations of organizations like the international telecommunications union to serve such a function. the very idea that an international organization could enforce rules on the misuse of computers is __ludicrous.__ the problem of cyber arms control is akin to the greatest arms control failure of the cold war, which still __persists:__ the mass distribution of the most produced firearm in human history, the kalashnikov __ak-47.__ according to the world bank, as many as 100 million of these brutally simple weapons are scattered across the globe __(roughly__ one for every 70 people on the planet, and that excludes the millions of western military rifles out there, __too).__ from every major trouble spot, we see footage of __kalashnikov-wielding__ soldiers, terrorists and rebels. global attempts to sweep up such weapons, as well as their bigger and more volatile relatives -- rocket-propelled grenades -- have been mostly ineffective. the u.n. has worked for more than a decade on an arms trade treaty designed to limit the illicit trade of such weapons, but a final draft of the treaty is stalled. for better or for worse, the internet has become one more field upon which the game of nations is played. just as the internet can be used for sharing information and enabling commerce, it can also be used to steal secrets and to cause damage. in the short term, we might see private industry adopt defensive practices. in the long term, while we may never be able to eliminate electronic espionage, we may be able to reduce its reach through vigilance and diplomacy. as for cyber arms control, forget about it. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of christopher __bronk__ and dan __wallach.__

(cnn) -- woody allen famously said that 80% of success in life is about just showing up. he's wrong. success in life -- as in diplomacy -- is about showing up at the right time. so is john kerry coming to the __israeli-hamas__ crisis too early, too late or just at the right time? the secretary of state has been eager to get into the middle of this almost since it started. he considered going last weekend from vienna, austria, where he had joined five other world powers in negotiations with iran on the nuclear deal. but he smartly decided -- or was discouraged by the egyptians who were in the middle of their own cease-fire mediation -- not to go. still, the rising number of deaths primarily on the palestinian side and the real danger of escalation of a ground incursion left him little choice. regardless of the outcome, after syria and iraq, both president barack obama and kerry realized that the united states couldn't sit on the sidelines like a __potted__ plant. kerry arrives in israel . moreover, kerry's hot mic comments showing his irritation at israel's supposed __"pinpoint"__ airstrikes in gaza revealed a good deal more frustration than simply a desire to collect more frequent flier miles. kerry is an activist and simply couldn't abide the fact that people were dying and the united states wasn't at least trying to stop it. but desire and passion won't produce a deal. kerry proved that in his nine-month effort to negotiate an agreed framework for peace between israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu and palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas. so what will it take to negotiate a cease-fire, and is kerry the guy to do it? a key question is whether the combatants now believe it is urgent to reach a __cease-fire:__ you would think that with more than 600 palestinians dead, thousands wounded and displaced, and israel soldiers' casualties rising, the conflict would have created an imperative for __de-escalation.__ and it may eventually bring both hamas and israel to the point that a cease-fire is a top priority. at the same time, israel's successful iron dome missile defense system has insulated the government to a degree from popular pressure to stand down, and the united states generally has been supportive of israel's right to defend itself. but palestinian civilian casualties have increased international pressure. and tuesday's federal aviation administration decision to stop flights to and from israel temporarily will remind israelis about the costs of the continuing confrontation. as for hamas, it's not easy to read its __calculations,__ in part because it's not clear whether the military or political wing is in charge. but it is evident that having entered this conflict financially strapped and politically weak, hamas leaders believe they need to show something tangible for the death and destruction their missiles have produced in gaza. and, by infiltrating israel through tunnels and confrontation with israelis in gaza, they have inflicted more fatalities on the israel defense forces than they did in the entire three-week war of __2008/9.__ indeed, hamas seems convinced this fight could continue for a while longer. bottom line: both sides may be reaching a tipping point when pain outweighs gain. but they just may not be there quite yet. a second key question is who is in a position to mediate the deal. kerry's formidable energy and talent notwithstanding, he cannot do this deal on his own. washington has plenty of influence with israel under the right circumstances but none with hamas. and that means relying on regional partners who do. but that poses a variety of complications. egypt wants to maintain the key role here while keeping qatar and turkey at bay to limit their __pro-hamas__ __leanings.__ still the deal will likely require payment of hamas employee salaries and the qataris may be the banker on that one. egypt and hamas will also need to work out some new arrangement to ease crossings from rafah -- the largest pedestrian crossing from gaza to egypt. israel also wants to limit the gains hamas makes. it wants a clean cease-fire first and only then arrangements that might satisfy some of what hamas is __seeking.__ in the middle of this is a secretary of state who's very much __improvising__ in an effort to determine who has the most influence with hamas and how best to go about using it. at the end of the day, it's no coincidence that kerry stopped in egypt first. cairo will remain the __fulcrum__ of this process. the final question is what kind of deal could be achieved. the simplest way to conclude this round would be quiet for __quiet:__ no more hamas rockets and no more israeli military action. but it's probably too late for that kind of a cease-fire, and it would likely only be a temporary __respite.__ at the other extreme are a variety of proposals from __demilitarization__ to __reoccupation__ of gaza by israel to eliminating hamas as an organization. but none of these are realistic. the best that can be hoped for is a kind of stability for stability in which a long-term cease-fire would be followed by a number of arrangements to open up gaza economically in exchange for hamas' commitment to stand down and ensure that there would be no attacks against israel via tunnels and rockets. indeed israel may well demand the border with gaza be supervised to prevent reconstruction and reuse of hamas' terror tunnels. in exchange, a number of parties would be asked to deliver on certain __commitments:__ qatar would pay promised salaries for hamas employees under the __fatah-hamas__ unity __accord;__ egypt would allow the rafah crossing to be opened under terms to be __negotiated;__ israel would agree to open its crossings with gaza, perhaps with the return -- even in a symbolic manner -- of palestinian authority officials in some role in gaza. egypt would continue to crack down on military __contraband,__ slowing hamas' capacity to __rearm.__ and the united nations -- together with international donors -- would work to deal with the humanitarian costs of the current crisis. sooner or later, something along these lines will be put together. and kerry can work to assemble part of it. but it will be egypt that will drive the train, not just because of its desire to be the key actor, but also to limit the outside influences of others. and of all the potential __mediators,__ including the united states, israel would likely prefer cairo, which shares its objective of limiting hamas gains. none of this will provide a long-term solution to an __israel-hamas__ __rivalry,__ let alone to the broader question of how to reach a two-state solution of the israeli-palestinian problem. but it will bring to an end another costly round of israeli-palestinian violence. and the time for that is long overdue.

(cnn) -- making a video game __espousing__ the virtues of compassion, sacrifice and spirituality doesn't sound like a winner in today's __battle-happy__ gaming environment. but 27 years ago, it was exactly the type of game that caught the imagination and spurred excitement in __gamers.__ developers at __bioware__ are hoping to catch that same virtual lightning in a bottle with __"ultima__ __forever:__ quest for the __avatar,"__ the next chapter in the search for the avatar of __britannia.__ in it, the hero must achieve the highest levels in eight __virtues:__ __valor,__ justice, honor, compassion, honestly, humility, sacrifice and __spirituality.__ through actions in the game, players strive to become a shining example of good for the population. the new title is based off __"ultima__ __iv,"__ a computer game dating all the way to 1985. it is considered one of the most innovative games ever because of its __divergence__ from the typical __hack-and-slash__ approach. lead designer kate __flack__ said __"ultima__ __forever"__ hopes to bring back the appeal of being a good person in a video game. __"games__ are a cultural __artifact.__ they are affected by all the things around them," __flack__ said. the developers of __"ultima__ __iv"__ "were saying games can be about being a good person. at the time, it was in reaction to a backlash against the violence and things in video games. "i think the parallel nowadays is that we are almost frightened of high fantasy. if it's not covered in blood, we don't believe it. i'm going to be as subversive as __'ultima__ __iv'__ was at the time." __"ultima__ __forever"__ picks up 21 years after __"ultima__ __iv"__ left off. players can join up to three friends, as each works toward the goal of becoming the virtuous "avatar" of the land. while the __graphics,__ look and feel have obviously been upgraded due to advancements in technology over the years, __flack__ said the concept still remains true to what it was nearly three decades ago. "it's about mastering yourself, not mastering the world," she said. "when (a __non-player__ __character)__ asks you a question ... you are forced to pause and ask yourself, 'what do i think is the right thing to do? do i want to be kind, or do i want to be __fair?__ what kind of person am __i?'__ " rather than seeing how many creatures a player can kill or how much gold they can __accumulate,__ __flack__ is more interested in getting inside the player's head. she says the game is almost like a personality test, giving players choices in the attempt to be a good person. how they get there is up to them. "it's not like the game is going to grab you by the throat and make you make these choices. it is a slow __drip-drip-drip.__ and maybe they will start to recognize these same choices in their real life and become better people," she said. as players progress, choices need to be made about questions that don't always have black-and-white answers. you find a bag of gold, which you know was stolen. do you give it to the authorities __(honesty),__ donate it to the church __(spirituality)__ or hand it over to a starving family __(compassion)?__ keeping it, which would be the likely choice in most of today's games, doesn't help you win this one. __bioware__ designer alec __fisher-lasky__ was a former arlington county, virginia, police officer before deciding to get into video games. he says the decisions made in __"ultima__ __forever"__ are similar to the types of decisions he had to make while on the force -- just at a much slower pace. "when i found out they were working on the __'ultima'__ series, i was really excited about it. it ties into what i had done as a police officer facing these kinds of moral decisions every day," __fisher-lasky__ said. "i wanted to give that experience to players. what do i do in this __situation?__ what are the __consequences?__ why would i do this one thing over __another?"__ he said it was a challenge to make the player feel like their choices truly matter. if designers have done their job well, he __thinks,__ people will care about their __in-game__ decisions and really examine what kind of person outside of the game they are to make those choices. __"ultima__ __forever"__ will be released __free-to-play__ for pcs and the ipad this year, with more character classes, content and platforms announced later. __flack__ said __bioware's__ experience with massively multiplayer online games allowed it to stuff a lot of detail into the mobile version without sacrificing its look on more powerful __pcs.__ fans are already reacting to the early news of a new __"ultima"__ game. players who played __"iv"__ in their youth have said on the __"ultima__ __forever"__ facebook page that they are looking forward to sharing a similar experience with their kids. diehard fans of the franchise are also very excited. __"'ultima__ __iv'__ is the game that all modern __(role-playing__ __games)__ flow from, but it's also kind of the impossible __platonic__ ideal of a __(computer__ role-playing __game),"__ said __retro-gamer__ ben __lesnick,__ 31, of washington. "it came at this incredibly special time in game development history where that kind of game could exist. really, if __'ultima__ __forever'__ is one-tenth as __engrossing__ as __'ultima__ __iv,'__ then we'll have a pretty fantastic game that's worth playing on its own __merits."__ __flack__ said she tried to be respectful while working on this project. she understands the history and emotion tied into the franchise and didn't want to override people's memories of the game. "it's not going to suit everybody," she said. "and in fact, making a game that does suit everybody is going to let the fans down more, in a way. it's __bland.__ it's __insipid.__ it's the worst possible thing you can do with __'ultima.'__ i'd rather try and make a statement than not." players may sign up now to be involved in the __"ultima__ __forever"__ beta test.

__(cnn)private__ spaceflight company spacex scrubbed a scheduled rocket launch tuesday, in which it planned to attempt the pioneering step of landing the __rocket's__ first stage on a floating platform. the next possible launch attempt is at __5:09__ a.m. et friday, nasa said via twitter, __"pending__ resolution of the issue." nasa and spacex said the problem was with the falcon 9 __rocket's__ second stage, rather than the section it plans to try to land. "during the terminal count engineers observed drift on one of the two thrust __vector__ __actuators__ on the second stage that would likely have caused an automatic __abort.__ engineers called a hold in order to take a closer look," said john taylor, of spacex communications. the thrust __vector__ control __actuators__ are used to steer the rocket in flight. the second stage of the rocket delivers the payload -- in this case, supplies for the international space station -- to the desired orbit. __spacex's__ attempt to land the falcon 9 __rocket's__ first stage has been the chief focus of interest ahead of its latest resupply mission. recycling rockets . traditionally, rockets have been designed to fall back to earth after separating from the spacecraft they lifted, and then burn up on re-entry or crash into the ocean. the millions of dollars that go into the production of the rockets __burn,__ too. spacex wants to pioneer a reusable rocket, a development that could change the economics of space travel. "a fully and rapidly reusable rocket -- which has never been done before -- is the pivotal breakthrough needed to substantially reduce the cost of space __access,"__ spacex said in a statement. the company has twice attempted soft landings of the falcon __9's__ first stage on water. those tests showed that the rocket is capable of reducing its speed from __hypersonic__ to nearly zero, and deploy landing legs. in those tests, the rocket tipped sideways and crashed into the ocean, causing damage that made the rocket __unusable.__ that was according to plan, spacex said. landing on a moving target . when the launch happens, the company will try the same soft landing for the falcon __9's__ first stage, but this time on a __custom-built__ floating platform it calls the autonomous spaceport drone ship. landing on the platform "is significantly more __challenging"__ than the water __landings,__ the company said. for one, the platform is not __anchored,__ and while it looks large from the ground, it is a rather small target for the __14-story-tall__ rocket. spacex described __reentry__ and landing as "trying to balance a rubber __broomstick__ on your hand in the middle of a wind storm." the company puts the odds of success at 50% at best. it adds, however, that this is just the first of a number of tests toward the goal of landing a rocket stage for __reuse.__ as for the target, __"x"__ marks the __spot:__ the company will try to land the rocket stage on the spacex logo painted on the center of the floating platform. keith smith, of britain's royal astronomical society, told cnn the reason for using the platform -- despite the complications of landing on a moving target -- was that it should prevent any properties on earth being damaged if the landing goes wrong. it's not unusual for a launch to be __aborted,__ he said, since there are so many elements at play. "the payload on this is so expensive to launch that you don't want to risk anything about it," he said. the timing of the next launch attempt will depend on how serious the problem is, he said. cnn's rachel crane contributed to this report.

(cnn) -- in a new __anti-israel,__ anti-u.s. video, an american al qaeda member makes reference to his jewish ancestry for the first time in an official al qaeda message. adam __yahiye__ __gadahn,__ also known as azzam the american, is seen in an earlier al qaeda video. in the video, adam __yahiye__ __gadahn,__ also known as azzam the american, discusses his roots as he __castigates__ u.s. policies and __deplores__ israel's offensive in gaza that started in late december 2008 and continued into january. "let me here tell you something about myself and my biography, in which there is a benefit and a __lesson,"__ gadahn says, as he __elicits__ support from his fellow muslims for "our weapons, funds and jihad against the jews and their allies everywhere." "your speaker has jews in his __ancestry,__ the last of whom was his __grandfather,"__ he says. growing up in rural california, gadahn embraced islam in the mid-1990s, moved to pakistan and has appeared in al qaeda videos before. he was indicted in the united states in 2006 on charges of treason and material support to al qaeda, according to the fbi. gadahn is on the fbi's most wanted list, with a reward of up to $1 million leading to his capture. fbi records show __gadahn's__ date of birth as september 1, 1978. the video -- in which gadahn speaks arabic, with english __subtitles__ -- surfaced on saturday. this account is based on an english transcript provided by __as-sahab__ media, the media production company used by al qaeda. __gadahn's__ jewish ancestry has been reported in the news media. but terrorism analyst laura mansfield says it is the first time gadahn acknowledged his jewish ancestry in an official al qaeda message. gadahn says his grandfather was a __"zionist"__ and "a __zealous__ supporter of the __usurper__ __entity,__ and a prominent member of a number of zionist hate __organizations."__ "he used to repeat to me what he claimed are the virtues of this entity and encouraged me to visit it, specifically the city of tel aviv, where relatives of ours live," says __gadahn,__ referring to israel. he says his grandfather gave him a book by israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu called "a place among the __nations"__ -- in which the __"rabid__ __zionist"__ sets out __"feeble__ arguments and __unmasked__ lies to justify the __jews'__ rape of muslim __palestine."__ but gadahn says that despite his youth at the time, he didn't heed his grandfather's words. "how can a person with an ounce of __self-respect__ possibly stand in the ranks of criminals and killers who have no __morals,__ no mercy, no humanity and indeed, no __honor?"__ he says in reference to __zionists__ and israel. "isn't it shameful enough for a person to carry the citizenship of america, the symbol of oppression and tyranny and advocate of terror in the __world?"__ mansfield thinks the video may have been made between late april and __mid-may,__ before president obama's speech in cairo, egypt, addressing u.s. relations with muslims. gadahn notes obama's inauguration, netanyahu's election in february, and obama's speech in turkey in april. specifically mentioning the gaza offensive and citing other hot spots such as iraq, afghanistan, chechnya and somalia, where the __"zio-crusader__ __alliance"__ is fighting his __"brothers,"__ he says "this __open-faced__ __aggression"__ comes as obama has risen to power. he __scorns__ obama's statements in his inaugural address and in turkey that america isn't and won't be at war with islam, and "other __deceptive,__ false and __sugarcoated__ words of __endearment__ and respect." he says obama's language is similar to words netanyahu uttered in the knesset in 1996. gadahn also backs the idea of targeting __"zio-crusader"__ interests anywhere in the world, not just "within __palestine."__

article 
the appearance friday in a lower manhattan courtroom of sulaiman abu __ghaith,__ osama bin laden's son-in-law and one-time al qaeda spokesman, to face charges of conspiracy to kill americans underlines the perhaps surprising fact that members ____ of bin laden's inner circle have been living in iran for the past decade or so. it was abu __ghaith's__ decision to leave the comparative safety of his longtime refuge in iran for turkey a few weeks ago that led to the chain of events that landed him in manhattan for trial. the leading turkish newspaper, __hurriyet,__ reported that abu ghaith was detained in the turkish capital, ankara, in early february. turkey then decided to deport him to his native kuwait via jordan, where he was intercepted by fbi agents, who escorted him to new york. as is well known, many of bin laden's family and members of his inner circle fled afghanistan for pakistan after the fall of the taliban in the winter of 2001, but what is less well known is that some also fled to neighboring iran. according to u.s. documents and officials, in addition to abu __ghaith,__ other of bin laden's inner circle who ended up in iran include the formidable military commander of al qaeda, saif __al-adel,__ a former egyptian special forces officer who had fought against the soviets in afghanistan, as well as saad bin laden, one of the al qaeda's leader older sons who has played some kind of leadership role in the group. saad bin laden spent the first six months of 2002 living in karachi in southern pakistan. from there he helped one of his father's wives, __khairiah__ bin laden, and several of his father's children to move from pakistan to iran. for years these bin laden family members all lived in the iranian capital, tehran, under some form of house arrest. their conditions were not __unpleasant,__ with time for visits to swimming pools and shopping trips. meanwhile, u.s. intelligence learned that some al qaeda operatives were living in the northern iranian town of __chalus,__ on the caspian sea. in 2002 a u.s. navy seal operation into __chalus__ was planned and then rehearsed somewhere along the u.s. gulf coast. the chairman of the joint chiefs, general richard myers, called off the assault because the information about where precisely the al qaeda members were living in __chalus__ was not clear. a year after that operation was called off, according to us and saudi officials, from his iranian refuge saif __al-adel__ authorized __al-qaeda's__ branch in saudi arabia to launch a series of terrorist attacks in the saudi kingdom that began in the capital riyadh in may 2003, a campaign that killed scores of saudis and __expatriates.__ bergen: trying bin laden's son-in-law in new york makes sense . on the face of it, the fact that a number of al qaeda leaders and operatives and bin laden family members found shelter in iran is __puzzling,__ as the shia __theocrats__ in the iranian regime are hostile to the sunni ultra __zealots__ in al qaeda, and vice versa. for al qaeda's operatives, life in iran was more secure than for many of their colleagues in pakistan who risked capture by pakistani forces working with the cia or death by cia drones. the iranian regime likely saw the al qaeda operatives as useful bargaining chips with the united states in the event of some kind of peace negotiations with the americans. that peace deal, of course, never happened. of course, for iran the __adage,__ "the enemy of my enemy is my friend" may have also come into play, although there doesn't seem to be evidence that iran and al qaeda have ever cooperated on a specific operation. that said, the 9/11 commission found that of the 19 __hijackers,__ __"8__ to 10 of the 14 saudi __"muscle"__ operatives traveled into or out of iran between october 2000 and february __2001."__ whether this was with any degree of iranian complicity is still an open question. the fact that leading members of al qaeda were based in iran from 2002 on was known to the u.s. government at the time. (in fact, in early 2003 counterterrorism officials briefed me about this __development).__ there is something of an irony here. this was during the same time period in which senior administration officials under president george w. bush were citing the alleged presence of al qaeda members in baghdad and a supposedly burgeoning alliance between al qaeda and iraq's leader saddam hussein as a key reason to go to war against __saddam,__ iran's bitter enemy. five years after the invasion of iraq, the senate select committee on intelligence concluded, as had every other official investigation of the matter, that in fact there was no __"cooperative__ relationship" between saddam and al qaeda. in late 2008 al qaeda operatives kidnapped __heshmatollah__ __attarzadeh-niyaki,__ an iranian diplomat, in the western pakistan city of peshawar. after holding the diplomat for over a year the militants quietly released him back to iran in the spring of 2010. this was part of a deal that allowed some of bin laden's family and al qaeda members living under house arrest in iran to __depart,__ according to a pakistani official familiar with the deal. this deal did not, however, mean that relations between the iranians and al qaeda suddenly became all __hunky__ __dory.__ documents recovered at bin laden's compound in abbottabad, pakistan, following the seal raid there on may 1, 2011, and since publicly released portray a rather tense relationship between al qaeda and the iranian authorities. in a letter that bin laden wrote just five days before he died he described a document from his son saad who had lived in iran for years "which exposes the truth of the iranian regime." what bin laden meant precisely by this is not clear, but taken together with some of the other letters that were found in his abbottabad compound it is obvious that bin laden and his men were quite __distrustful__ of the iranian regime. a letter to bin laden from his chief of staff dated 11 june 2009 has a detailed account about a group of __"mid__ level" al qaeda members who the iranians had recently released, including three egyptians, a __yemeni,__ a iraqi and a __libyan.__ bin laden's chief of staff attributed these releases to al qaeda's kidnapping of the iranian diplomat in peshawar, but added that the iranians "don't want to show that they are negotiating with us or reacting to our pressure. ... we ask god to repel their evil." in another undated letter from bin laden to his chief off staff al qaeda's leader gave a set of detailed instructions about how best to handle his family members living in iran once they were released. bin laden urged extreme caution "since the iranians are not to be __trusted."__ among another precautions, he wrote that his family members "should be warned about the importance of getting rid of everything they received from iran like baggage or anything even as small as a __needle,__ as there are eavesdropping chips that have been developed to be so small they can be put inside a medical __syringe."__ in this letter bin laden mentioned by name a number of his children living in iran including his sons __ladin,__ __uthman__ and muhammad and his daughter __fatima,__ who is married to sulaiman abu ghaith who now sits in a manhattan jail. in october the u.s. treasury named as terrorists six al qaeda members living in iran who it said are funding terrorist activities in pakistan and sending fighters and money to syria to fight the assad regime there. abu ghaith didn't play an operational role in al qaeda -- a fact that was underlined in the charges filed against him last week in manhattan that revolve around his role as a __propagandist__ for the group. so it is the precise nature of al qaeda's arrangements in iran and the kind of activities outlined in the recent treasury designation of the half-dozen al qaeda members living in iran that are likely to be of most interest to american investigators. given the fact that since 9/11, new york courts have convicted at a rate of 100% in cases that involve members of al qaeda and associated groups, abu ghaith could doubtless cut an attractive plea deal for himself if he gives a full accounting of al qaeda's murky decade in iran.

(cnn) -- mind over matter? or nature over __nurture?__ what is it that separates olympic legends like jamaican sprinter usain bolt and u.s. swimmer michael phelps from the millions of enthusiastic amateurs around the world? can training, dedication and the right mindset turn any sporting hopeful into a world-class __athlete?__ matthew __syed,__ author of __"bounce"__ and a former olympic table tennis player, believes that an individual's ability is secondary to the level of coaching they receive and the facilities to which they have access. "i think the idea of talent is misleading and in many ways __overrated,"__ syed told cnn's aiming for gold show. "when i became english no. 1, i thought i must be super __talented.__ but the top players in the country at that time, 80% of them didn't just come from the same town or the same suburb, but from the very same street. olympic goal: a __swimmer's__ story . "there hadn't been a genetic mutation -- we happened to have the best coach who gave us access to the only 24-hour club. "so we practiced before school, after school, at weekends, on holidays. over many years, we transformed ourselves from perfectly ordinary players into world-class players." so does practice in itself make the world's top athletes __perfect?__ not __necessarily,__ according to mental performance coach andy __barton.__ __"practice__ doesn't make perfect," he says. "you only have to think of your handwriting for instance, how as you get older the more you write the worse you get. "only perfect practice will make perfect. to improve you have to be very specific about what you are aiming to do and target it." it is a view supported by __syed,__ who suggests that the willingness of top athletes to push themselves further and further in practice pays dividends when it comes to high-pressure competition. "it's interesting, for example, that world-class ice dancers fall over more often in practice than intermediate ice dancers, which sounds __paradoxical,"__ he said. "the reason is they are always pushing themselves, they are attempting jumps that are at the outer limits of their capabilities. it's a branch of science called __'epigenetics'__ -- the brain is __re-wired__ as we practice." once athletes have meticulously honed their skills, they should, in theory, have all the tools at their disposal to achieve success. but in high-pressure situations, even the greatest can __crumble.__ what causes a footballer to crack under the __nail-biting__ strain of a penalty __shootout?__ or a tennis star to fall apart at match point? "the problem when you're under pressure is you're so nervous you start thinking consciously about the shot you are playing," syed says. "you are __intruding__ upon your __subconscious__ __competence,__ and that is what triggers the choking response." so how can olympians preparing for london 2012 ensure they are mentally ready to challenge for __gold?__ barton suggested that imagining the crowning moment is almost as important as physically training for it. "the thing about when we mentally rehearse something __vividly,__ it actually fires up the same neurology in the brain as if we were really experiencing it. so on a certain level the mind cannot differentiate between a __vividly-imagined__ experience and reality. "what we need to do is to create our own realities in our heads so you can imagine yourself in that olympic final, for instance, performing how you want to perform. "the more you actually do that, the more your body and mind get used to it, so when you come to the real thing, you're more __prepared."__ so the next time you find yourself __daydreaming__ of sprinting to 100 meters gold, don't dismiss it -- it might just be vital preparation for your future olympic success.

(cnn) -- with all sides vowing __politicking__ isn't in order, republican presidential nominee mitt romney got a close-up view friday of the devastation caused this week by hurricane isaac -- days ahead of a visit by his november __foe,__ president barack obama. romney went to louisiana's jefferson parish, __glimpsing__ the flooding and downed trees along with gov. bobby jindal and sen. david __vitter,__ both fellow republicans. the former massachusetts governor, accompanied by his wife, __ann,__ said the trip was "to learn and obviously to draw some attention to what's going __(on)__ __here...__ so that people around the country know that people down here need help." hours earlier, the white house announced that obama canceled a trip to cleveland and would instead head monday to louisiana. obama will meet officials dealing with __isaac's__ impact and "making sure that __unmet__ needs are being met and that the federal response led by fema is helping citizens in the affected areas and the state and local officials who are responding to the storm," white house press secretary jay carney said. the president on friday addressed the situation to start his speech to troops in fort __bliss,__ texas. he vowed the government will "keep doing everything that it can" to help those suffering due to the storm. "as a country, we stand united with our fellow americans in their time of need," obama said. jindal echoed that view, saying he was __"thrilled"__ both major party's presidential nominees were making time to visit his state. "there's no time for partisan politics in louisiana at this point in time," jindal said. mary landrieu, the democratic senator from louisiana, made a political point directed at romney during a news conference in plaquemines parish. she said she hopes the republican nominee will realize the importance of the army corps of engineers and its projects that tackle hurricanes and storm damage. she called the agency's budget __"underfunded."__ "two billion dollars is not nearly enough new investment in core infrastructure for our nation, so one of the things i hope __(romney)__ sees firsthand when he's here is that," she said. "i realize he's all about cutting the federal budget, but this is one agency that absolutely cannot take any additional __cuts,"__ she said. isaac made landfall on the seventh anniversary of hurricane katrina, which overwhelmed levees and contributed to nearly 1,800 deaths. after slamming into the united states as a category 1 hurricane on tuesday, isaac weakened considerably but still dumped ample rain as it headed north through arkansas and toward missouri. "there are some individuals in the metropolitan area of new orleans that have suffered damages in excess of what they suffered during __katrina,"__ said mayor mitch landrieu, where 20 inches of rain fell, according to the national weather service. with 25 mph sustained winds, the tropical depression moved friday night into the middle mississippi river valley, where it is expected to dump several more inches of rain, the national weather service said. by saturday night, it should start affecting the ohio river valley. already, isaac caused at least 19 deaths in haiti while churning north from the caribbean and into the gulf of mexico and then another four in louisiana and mississippi. it has also left its share of destruction and headaches, many of which persisted on friday. that includes hundreds of thousands without power around the gulf coast, including __430,000__ entergy louisiana customers friday evening. such such storm-related problems led the louisiana department of agriculture and forestry to offer up to 50 gallons of fuel per day for purchase by dairy farmers who were without power. the same department noted more than 160,000 gallons of diesel and __138,000__ gallons of __unleaded__ fuel had been requested by hospitals, law enforcement agencies and other emergency operators. floodwaters remained high, meanwhile, in numerous parishes where the lingering heavy rain combined with storm surges to __inundate__ scores homes and businesses. in plaquemines parish, for instance, officials intentionally breached a levee to help drain floodwater in nearby communities. the bodies of a man and woman were found in 7 feet of water in the kitchen of a home in the parish, officials said late thursday. an autopsy will determine the cause of the death for the couple, nungesser said. in st. __tammany__ parish, a __slidell__ resident was killed while driving through four feet of __floodwater,__ state police said. ascension parish announced voluntary evacuations for parts of the region. animals have also been impacted -- from the 94 cats and dogs in shelters in alexandria and another 63 in __haughton,__ to state authorities waiving restrictions to allow beef cattle to be evacuated from louisiana to texas. the storm had a "major impact" in mississippi, gov. phil bryant said. the state was among those soaked by the storm, including 17 inches in __kiln.__ a falling tree killed a tow truck driver in the state as he was attempting to clear debris on a road, officials said. water levels at __700-acre__ lake __tangipahoa__ dropped friday as authorities pumped water from it, meaning a damaged __earthen__ dam may not have to be __breached,__ mississippi emergency management spokesman brett carr said. "we don't know if it's going to be enough," said carr of the water level __drops.__ "we are clearing land in preparation for the __cut."__ residents living within a half-mile of the __tangipahoa__ river, which runs from the lake south into louisiana, remain under an evacuation order. officials in louisiana say two bridges in __tangipahoa__ parish have been closed because the river's water level has been too high. amid such continued challenges and the massive __clean-up,__ there were also signs friday of life returning to normal. days after closing off the __waterway,__ the coast guard captain at the new orleans port on friday reopened the mississippi river, from baton rouge to the mouth of the river, to limited vessel traffic. "although the mississippi river was heavily impacted by the storm, the navigational channel is in good condition. the coast guard is working with the maritime industry to respond to a number of ship __groundings__ and barge __strandings__ along the __riverbank__ caused by the river surge and high winds of the storm," the coast guard said. and louis armstrong new orleans international airport officials said friday that flights had resumed and commercial power had been restored. __terrebonne__ parish in louisiana announced, meanwhile, that its curfew had been lifted, its government offices reopened and its public transit system was back in operation -- though a boil water advisory remains in effect. jindal praised the selfless actions of people, like a caretaker who stayed behind to help nursing home patients despite losing homes during isaac and katrina. "i'm in awe of the generosity and resilience of the people," he said. cnn's brian todd and rich phillips contributed to this report.

"i hope that he'd be released earlier because of the prize, but in reality, that will not happen," __shang__ told cnn. a chinese foreign ministry spokesman said the awarding of the prize to liu was __"blasphemy__ against the peace __prize"__ that could harm relations between china and norway. __"liu__ xiaobo is a convicted criminal sentenced to jail by chinese justice. his acts are in complete contradiction to the purpose of the nobel peace __prize,"__ spokesman ma __zhaoxu__ said. the human rights group amnesty international called on the chinese government to release all __"prisoners__ of __conscience"__ following the win. __"liu__ xiaobo is a worthy winner of the nobel peace prize. we hope it will keep the spotlight on the struggle for fundamental freedoms and concrete protection of human rights that liu xiaobo and many other activists in china are dedicated to," said catherine __baber,__ the deputy asia-pacific director at amnesty international. u.s. president barack obama, who won the award last year, said liu had sacrificed his freedom for his beliefs. liu, he said, is an __"eloquent__ and courageous spokesman for the advance of universal values through peaceful and non-violent means, including his support for democracy, human rights, and the rule of law." obama also urged china to release liu as soon as possible. it was unclear whether liu had learned of his prize from prison, but he was the favorite of many around the world to win. the president of the norwegian nobel committee, __thorbjoern__ __jagland,__ said liu won for his "long and nonviolent struggle for fundamental human rights in china." in announcing the prize, he said, "the norwegian nobel committee has long believed that there is a close connection between human rights and peace. such rights are a prerequisite for the fraternity between nations of which __[prize__ __founder]__ alfred nobel wrote in his will." liu's struggle has made him the __"foremost__ __symbol"__ of the struggle for human rights in his country, __jagland__ said. despite the criticism from china, the committee stood by its choice and said it had expected china to react __strongly.__ "we have a very strong tradition of awarding the prize to human rights activists of many different __kinds,"__ __geir__ __lundestad,__ director of the nobel institute, told cnn. the institute assists the committee in selecting the prize each year. __lundestad__ cited german __pacifist__ and journalist carl von __ossietsky__ in __1935,__ holocaust survivor elie __wiesel__ in 1986, myanmar pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi in 1991, and iranian campaigner __shirin__ ebadi in 2003 as examples of human rights activists who have won the prize. "this is a tradition we are very proud of, and this is a tradition for which the norwegian nobel committee has received much __applause,"__ __lundestad__ said. "we felt that if we were serious about this tradition, we did have to come to terms with the question of china in this perspective, and this is what we then did this year." the winner of the nobel peace prize receives 10 million swedish __kronor__ __($1.5__ million), to be picked up at the award ceremony in december. liu spoke of his work in 2007, while he was between a series of house arrests. "from my personal angle, i feel in a __dictatory__ society if you want to be a person with dignity, if you want to be an honest person, fight for human-rights improvement, fight for free speech, being ... [in __prison]__ is part of what you are __undertaking,__ and there is nothing to __complain,"__ he told cnn. "since you chose to do this, you must have a preparation for being in prison," he said. __"entering__ the prison you must face these things peacefully, not complain __[about]__ others. i even don't complain __[about__ __those]__ ... who arrested me, because this is their inevitable action. i can also not let them arrest me if i chose other way." twitter users in china were unable to discuss liu or the nobel prize on the micro-blogging site, but some still reacted to the award. "i am so excited when i heard this news! finally good people is recognized by the __world!"__ wrote one twitter user. "they censored what i've just posted on micro __blog!__ can you really stop people in this internet __age!"__ wrote another. at least two international television networks -- cnn and bbc -- were blacked out as the nobel committee announced the winner, and cnn remained blacked out for most of the day. __pu,__ liu's friend, was refused entry to the apartment complex by security guards when he went there friday night. a human rights lawyer and partner in the __huayi__ law firm in beijing -- where he focuses on __defamation,__ press freedom and other public interest law -- __pu__ said the prize is a step forward for chinese development. __"liu's__ nobel prize shows that he will have an impact beyond how far the eye can see. this will change the future long into the future," he told cnn, adding that liu is "like an older brother to me." liu's sentencing prompted a groundswell of support from former peace prize laureates and perennial contenders. vaclav __havel,__ the hero of __czechoslovakia's__ 1989 velvet revolution (who never won the nobel __prize),__ retired south african archbishop desmond tutu (who did, in __1984),__ and the dalai lama __(1989)__ were among a group of intellectuals who publicly urged the nobel committee to give the prize to liu shortly after he was __sentenced.__ american writer kwame anthony __appiah,__ the head of the american pen center, a literary and human rights organization, nominated liu in january, he said. __"liu__ xiaobo is a hero among heroes," said rep. chris smith, r-new jersey, who also nominated him. "this award will be a shot of adrenaline for all chinese human rights advocates and prisoners of __conscience."__ the wall street journal reported in february that foreign ministry spokesman ma said that it would be "totally wrong" for "such a person" to win the nobel peace prize, and that the comment was later scrubbed from the official transcript of the briefing. cnn's jo ling kent and steven jiang, and journalist tomas __etzler,__ contributed to this report.

although it's been in the works -- and riled __alarmists__ __(whoopi__ goldberg had some choice words to share back in __may)__ -- for a while, new york city's __"latch__ on __nyc"__ initiative, which will be put into practice in 27 of the city's 40 hospitals beginning on september 2, has caught a recent wave of inflammatory __flack__ among various __'news'__ sources, mom bloggers, and more. __nyc's__ mayor bloomberg announced the initiative shortly after the __aap__ released its new breastfeeding recommendations, which cite an ever-growing body of data supporting __breastfeeding's__ benefits to babies, moms, and the economy, and stressed __hospitals'__ important role in this picture. his initiative also followed the public appeal of dozens of consumer and health organizations, to hospitals, to stop doling out corporate formula __swag__ bags to every new mom they __discharge.__ __breastfeeding's__ health benefits are __indisputable,__ as are its dismal rates among american __moms.__ parenting.com: 15 toddler __superfoods__ . on the __up-side,__ however, studies have shown repeatedly that exposure to information about breastfeeding increases __moms'__ desire to give it a __whirl.__ and early, hands-on support __(followed__ by a supportive workplace and public __sphere)__ helps make it really happen. since us health officials hope to almost double the nursing count by 2020, hospitals seem like the logical place to start. it surprises me that latch on nyc has received such vocal criticism. and frankly, much of the recent criticism is based more in the alleged __"breastfeeding__ __debates"__ and their crossfire than in, you know, reality. more on that in a minute. first, here's the latch on nyc plan: in addition to a __pro-breastfeeding__ public transport poster campaign (not the first in the country by any __means),__ voluntarily complying hospitals __will:__ . - enforce the new york state hospital regulation to not supplement breastfeeding infants with formula unless medically indicated and documented on the infant's medical __chart-__ limit access to infant formula by hospital __staff-__ discontinue the distribution of promotional or free infant __formula-__ prohibit the display and distribution of infant formula advertising or promotional materials in any hospital location . what this means __is:nurses__ must document the dispensing of formula to new moms, citing a medical reason for its necessity. i.e. nurses will need to actually talk with new moms, and provide them with information and support in trying to __breastfeed__ before they hand out formula. given the difficulty i had in getting any breastfeeding support after my nyc hospital delivery, i would have welcomed some policy backing my requests. but for new moms who just plain don't want to __breastfeed,__ this definitely represents a change of __tides...__ not by much, though. no one will be forced to __breastfeed__ if they truly don't want to, __obviously.__ parenting.com: best cities for families . this policy provides an official way to hold hospitals accountable, rather than to condemn women's choices. in fact, the initiative clearly states that __"mothers__ who decide to formula feed and cannot afford formula will be referred to __wic__ __(women,__ infants and __children),__ a food and nutrition program for low-income families." i.e. the government is still giving out free formula to those who want to feed it to their babies but can't afford to buy it. this is hardly an __anti-formula-feeding__ campaign. (but it definitely is a __pro-breastfeeding__ __one).__ next up, limiting formula access means only that there'll be an extra step between a mom delivering her baby and a nurse handing her formula. namely, the mom will need to ask for it. again, i read this as a way to hold hospitals accountable for attending to each patient personally. finally, __discontinuing__ corporate __swag__ __(promotional__ materials and actual __formula)__ is a big deal, and a huge step. __karol__ __markowicz's__ (of the new york __post)__ opinion that "a mother isn't going to choose to feed her baby formula because she got a free __lanyard__ or __tote__ __bag"__ notwithstanding, the fact is that corporations are, by definition, the opposite of charitable __organizations;__ they vie for access to new moms __in-hospital__ because, a) brand loyalty is not to be __underestimated,__ and b) mothers assume hospitals have their patients' (i.e. the moms and babies they care __for)__ best interests at heart. parenting.com: 36 tips for breastfeeding success . so if a given formula is provided -- along with __"informational__ __literature"__ -- actually in the hospital, that formula must be, by __affiliation,__ a __baby's-best-interest__ choice. (it's a __subconscious,__ logical __conclusion.)__ of course babies can, and do, thrive on formula, but there's no debate in the medical field as to breast __milk's__ nutritional __superiority.__ by providing education and support around __breastfeeding,__ and removing formula manufacturers from the picture, hospitals are actually operating with increased professional __integrity;__ they are actually providing the best possible care to patients. and in some cases, this will mean providing formula to __babies...__ is it really so horrible that this won't come with a bunch of pr from __nestle?__ __no.as__ far as the controversy and crossfire is concerned, the post's __karol__ __markowicz,__ despite her __anything-but-objective__ objections to the initiative, made one __apt,__ if __obnoxiously-presented,__ point in her __critique.__ lisa __paladino,__ of staten island university hospital, had been quoted in this other post article, explaining that under the new system, a nurse will need to sign out each bottle of formula issued. __markowicz__ writes, "perhaps __paladino__ has never been around a hungry infant, but she should anticipate a cacophony of screams while perpetually __understaffed__ hospitals find nurse's aides to sign out formula like it's __morphine."__ while her analogy is rather __unhinged,__ her point about __understaffing__ is __important;__ i was really kind of freaked out, __post-delivery,__ by how little the nurses seemed to care for -- or even check on -- ____ my well-being. when the __'nurse__ __button'__ proved __pointless,__ i ended up __hobbling__ down the hallway, __barefoot,__ in search of a glass of drinking water. i was, meanwhile, nervous about my own abilities with a __newborn,__ and the lack of nurse oversight made me afraid that if my baby needed something while with me in my room __(something__ even more urgent than breastfeeding support, which definitely wasn't __forthcoming),__ there wouldn't be a good way to get medical __help...__ in a hospital. yeah. i know my breastfeeding experience -- and entire __post-delivery__ experience -- would have been improved with better __post-natal__ care, along with one-on-one breastfeeding help. bloomberg's initiative, along with the recent research pointing to the crucial role that hospitals play in breastfeeding success, will hopefully motivate hospitals to equip themselves with adequate nursing staffs in order to really attend to helping new moms get their __bearings__ -- around __breastfeeding,__ and otherwise. if they don't, this plan could __backfire.__ but if they do, and it __succeeds,__ it could prove to be a positive model for hospitals to follow, __nation-wide.__ parenting.com: the most awkward pregnancy photos ever . for her part, __markowicz__ has little else to offer. she __dubs__ bloomberg's initiative an __"anti-formula__ __crusade"__ and writes that breastfeeding hardly needs a __policy-backed__ __boost,__ __stating,__ "a mere 50 years ago, 75 percent of american infants were using __formula;__ breastfeeding was the odd way to feed a child." true, but fifty years ago -- 1962 -- was not exactly a progressive time in american history, particularly for women and __babies:__ __thalidomide__ for morning __sickness?__ twilight sleep __births?__ __hello?__ __markowicz__ has cited the least natural point in mainstream american birth practices as a way to ostensibly __'naturalize'__ formula __feeding's__ prime place in our hospitals today. it's a flimsy argument, and a strange __respose__ to a __(voluntary)__ change in policy here in __2012.those__ who are kicking up __(badly-written,__ and poorly __supported)__ dust around latch on nyc are fueling negativity for its own sake, as well as __divisiveness__ for the sake of attention (and page views, which add up to advertising __sales).__ let's not get sucked in. at the end of the day, the __post-delivery__ hospital stay is, under normal circumstances, quite brief. a couple of days won't keep __formula-minded__ moms from feeding their babies formula. but it can make all the difference in getting moms who want to __breastfeed__ onto a successful track. and greater numbers of successfully breastfeeding babies will make for a healthier population of babies, and moms, overall. this is a fact. this is why bloomberg jumped in to this incredibly controversial territory -- breastfeeding issues and corporate interests in health care __(wow,__ __double-whammy)__ -- in the first place. getting swept up in demonizing him, or in any uproar around this new policy, __distracts__ from what the initiative really means for new moms (more __support)__ and for hospitals __(step__ it __up).it's__ going to be __okay!__ it's not 1962 anymore. what do you think of the latch on nyc __initiative?__ what do you think all the uproar is really about?

the man's anger at authorities giving a briefing on malaysia airlines flight 370 could not be contained. he screamed at the screen as a promised video conference with malaysian authorities became the latest part of the aftermath of the plane's disappearance to encounter technical difficulties. "you're all bloody __liars,__ and you're lying to us again," the chinese man said, according to a translation. families of the passengers on the missing plane in attendance at the beijing briefing wednesday exploded in anger and stormed out. "we will request their team of experts to come to beijing to conduct face-to-face communications and fulfill their __commitment,"__ said __jing__ __hui,__ a spokesman for some of the families. "what is the __truth?__ what problem do they want to cover up?" the families have 26 questions they want answered now. the queries were posted on the social media site weibo by a committee representing some of the passengers' relatives. some of the __"questions"__ are requests that evidence be shared with them, including the flight's __logbook__ and recording of air traffic control on march 8, the night the plane disappeared with 239 people aboard. most of the people on the plane were chinese, and their families have become very __distrustful__ of malaysian government authorities and officials with the airline. that was apparent in the request for __mh370's__ log book. john __goglia,__ a former member of the u.s. national transportation safety board, told cnn the log is usually on the plane and even if it wasn't, investigators wouldn't reveal specific information from it. he also said a request for phone numbers of investigators would be denied. but the other 24 questions and __requests?__ "these are not state secrets so the families should have access to all of that kind of information," he said. many of the 26 questions focus on technical issues involving emergency locator __transmitters,__ or __elts,__ and "black __boxes."__ with an apparent in-depth understanding of how these work, the families ask about the specific technology on the missing plane. __elts__ are designed to activate after a crash and send a signal to a frequency monitored by air traffic controllers. "black __boxes,"__ or voice and data recorders, could shed light on what went on in the plane's cockpit and other crucial flight information. the families' final seven questions involve __"protocol,"__ including this: what did malaysia airlines do when the flight went __missing?__ the families also ask whether search and rescue teams have final results from searched areas, and whether the malaysian government could specify the rights of family members "to know the facts of cases or the details of an incident." malaysia airlines has said it shares all the information it has with appropriate authorities. in a video message this month, hugh __dunleavy,__ the airline's commercial director, said the company shares the same "fundamental __requirement"__ as the __families:__ to find out what happened. malaysian authorities have come under criticism repeatedly for their handling of the investigation. ____ but the government has insisted it's doing what it can to get to the bottom of what happened and support the families. "we understand that it has been a difficult time for all the families. ____ and we appreciate that many families want to see physical evidence before they will accept that mh370 ended in the southern indian ocean," acting transport minister hishammuddin hussein said at the end of march. ____ "... the question that the families principally want answered, is the question we simply do not have the answer to -- namely, where their loved ones are, and where is __mh370."__ a week earlier, hishammuddin made a pledge to the __families:__ "we will do everything in our power to keep you __informed."__ bluefin-21 completes __'full__ __search'__ after two previous setbacks that officials called minor, an underwater vessel searching for traces of mh370 resurfaced thursday morning after completing what search officials called a "full mission." the bluefin-21 has now searched a total of 90 square kilometers __(34.7__ square miles) in its first three trips to the ocean floor. on its second trip the bluefin was forced to __resurface__ after 11 hours because it needed to have a technical issue addressed. part of the equipment designed to help the bluefin-21 move deeper and avoid __seepage__ was low on oil. ____ officials __replenished__ the supply and __redeployed__ the vessel. the bluefin-21 has its electronics sealed in bottles so they are protected from __saltwater.__ ____ as the probe moves deeper and the pressure increases, the operating system pushes oil into these bottles. ____ the oil counters the pressure and prevents saltwater from seeping in. if oil fills the __container,__ there's no space for __saltwater.__ "in no way should this suggest that (the __auv)__ is not __'hardy'__ enough to be working at this depth. ____ on the contrary, it is absolutely the best piece of equipment for the job we are doing," a source close to the operation said, adding that technical issues are common at great __depths.__ data from its second and third mission have been __downloaded,__ the australian joint agency coordination centre said. there were no "significant __detections"__ during the second search. 24-hour mission . bluefin-21 takes two hours to get near the ocean floor and another two hours to return to the surface. it aims to map the ocean floor for 16 hours to retrieve data, which then take four hours to __analyze.__ the vessel searches maximum depths of 4,500 meters __(14,764__ feet), and before the technical __interruption,__ it was scheduled to complete its second dive about 10 a.m. et, a source said. the u.s. navy has determined the __seafloor__ in the search area reaches a maximum depth of __4,600__ meters __(15,092__ feet). the bluefin operators said they can __reprogram__ it to operate at 5,000 meters __(16,404__ feet), meaning it can search the originally designated area, which is thought to have yielded the most promising clues. it is where a second audio signal that searchers thought was __manmade__ and the right frequency to belong to the flight data __recorder's__ emergency __beacon.__ the quality of the __"ping"__ led authorities to focus the underwater search in the area. an oil sample taken from a slick on the surface in that section of the ocean is at a lab being analyzed to see if it is an aviation or maritime __fluid.__ __'garbage__ __patch'__ "we have known a long time that especially the recent search area, the new search area they are looking at now, there's a lot of debris there because it is close to what we call the garbage __patch,__ and that's where all of the garbage __accumulates,"__ said erik van __sebille,__ a physical __oceanographer__ at university of new south wales.

kandahar, afghanistan (cnn) -- hundreds of taliban fighters have taken over several villages in the same southern afghanistan province where about 400 taliban militants recently escaped from prison, local officials and police said. kandahar is the second biggest city in afghanistan and a former taliban __stronghold.__ about 400 to 500 taliban militants were seen streaming into the __arghandab__ district of the kandahar province late sunday night on motor bikes and pickup trucks, said haji aka __jan,__ a tribal elder in the district. abdul wali karzai, younger brother of afghan president hamid karzai and head of the provincial council, also said a large number of militants entered the district, and afghan and nato forces were preparing to come into the area. reports varied on how many villages were taken. taliban fighters have taken at least 5 villages and could have taken as many as 13, locals said. the villages area is about 20 km (12 miles) north of kandahar, a former stronghold for the taliban, and close to the prison escape. the daring and __well-executed__ __jail-break__ occurred friday and had coalition and afghan forces searching for __escapees.__ mark __laity,__ spokesman for nato-led international security assistance force __(isaf)__ said that they were aware of the report of attacks on villages. he said that afghan troops "are sending reinforcements and isaf forces are __redeploying__ within the city to see if there is any potential threat." the prison break and the taliban push have locals __fleeing,__ said __norine__ __macdonald,__ president of the __senlis__ council, a think tank that is based in the kandahar province. "hundreds of people are moving out to get away from the fighting," said __macdonald.__ "things are getting worse by the day, by the minute." macdonald said she has heard from locals that taliban fighters had taken villages by positioning heavily armed fighters on the streets in the area and telling village leaders that the taliban has taken control of the area. if the militants are not rooted out, they will try to create their own government in the area, macdonald said. pushing the taliban out will be very difficult, macdonald said. "it is extremely difficult to chase these guys out of the villages when they are not wearing uniforms that say 'i am the __taliban,'"__ macdonald said. "they can just put down their guns and blend in. nato may have to decide to bomb and that could bring civilian __casualties."__ in washington, u.s. defense secretary robert gates said the border region remains "a real problem" for allied troops battling a resurgent taliban and its al qaeda allies in afghanistan, particularly along the rugged border with pakistan. "they are more of a problem in the south in afghanistan than they are in the east," gates said in a speech to the north american forum. "we will just have to watch carefully and see how these agreements with the tribes are going." the incidence of attacks in afghanistan set record numbers in 2007 and remains on pace to match those figures this year, according to statistics from the u.s.-led coalition in afghanistan, obtained by cnn. as of june 6, the coalition had tallied __2,999__ attacks. that compares to __7,143__ during all of 2007 and up significantly from the __5,174__ attacks during 2006. the total for 2005 was __2,542__ and 2004 was __2,112.__ the __733__ attacks by roadside bombs and other improvised explosive devices through early june are on track to exceed the __1,313__ for all of last year. and the 72 recorded suicide bomb attacks in 2008 is a pace about equivalent to the 157 for 2007. journalist __farhad__ __peikar__ and cnn pentagon correspondent barbara starr and cnn's paul __courson__ contributed to this story.

el __cajon,__ california (cnn) -- khalid __yohana__ was 7 years old when war reached his hometown of mosul, iraq. for years, even the simplest activities, like walking to school, were an ordeal. "it was too scary to go outside much," __yohana,__ now 16, remembers. "if you walk on the street ... you're nervous you'd get killed." a group of men once tried to kidnap his father, a chef at a baghdad restaurant that catered to americans. the attempt failed, but a threatening letter arrived at his family's home that same night. "they warned us to get out of the country or they would kill us. ... i was really scared," __yohana__ said. the family fled to a small village north, but when __yohana's__ school was bombed a year later, they left iraq for good. they traveled to beirut, lebanon, and applied for refugee status so they could move to the united states legally. in 2010, __yohana__ and his family arrived in san diego. the family appreciated the safety of their new home, but they also encountered new problems. __yohana's__ father struggled to find work, and the entire family found it challenging to navigate a new country and culture. "it was really hard because we __(didn't)__ speak the language," __yohana__ said. he was often so discouraged by his poor english that he wouldn't even try to do his homework. the social isolation was worse. "it was really hard to find friends," __yohana__ said. "i was just sitting at home." while working as a refugee case manager for a nonprofit, mark __kabban__ saw many families like __yohana's__ struggle to find their footing in the united states. "you lose a lot of your dignity when you become a __refugee,"__ __kabban__ said. "you have to flee your country, depend on others. you lose your __self-esteem."__ __kabban__ said the transition can be particularly challenging for children, who face educational and social barriers. the stress they endure often puts them at risk of getting on the wrong track. "their families have sacrificed everything for them to get here. so if __(their__ __kids)__ don't succeed, that's the biggest tragedy," said __kabban,__ 25. "it's something that i'm not going to __allow."__ to help support young refugees, __kabban__ started the __yalla__ program in 2009. the name is an acronym for youth and leaders living __actively,__ but in arabic it simply means "let's go." __yalla__ provides free tutoring and soccer training to 200 boys and girls in the san diego area. while soccer is what mostly motivates the players, it's just a carrot to __kabban.__ many of his players have missed years of formal schooling on their road to the united states, so the mandatory __twice-a-week__ tutoring sessions are an integral part of the program. "when they get here, they're years behind, and they're years behind in a different language," __kabban__ said. "so the need is just __immense.__ we're working to get them __literate__ in english, getting them ... caught up." the __yalla__ staff also makes sure the players are registered to receive 25 hours of one-on-one tutoring from a statewide program. when necessary, __yalla__ also provides additional tutoring to those who are struggling. the hope is to help everyone get up to grade level and on a path to college. do you know a hero? nominations are open for 2012 cnn heroes . according to the u.s. state department, more than 10,000 refugees from around the world have moved to the san diego area legally since 2007, making it one of the largest refugee resettlement areas in the country. many of those __newcomers,__ like __yohana,__ are iraqis who are under 18. the vast majority live in el __cajon,__ a city in san diego county where __yalla__ is based. mark spreads the word about the group by visiting area schools. most of the players in the program are __iraqi,__ but the group has players from across the middle east, africa and asia. sometimes ethnic and religious differences can lead to conflict, but __kabban__ says that as the soccer season __progresses,__ the differences fall by the __wayside.__ "their families have endured the same __struggles,"__ __kabban__ said. "when they realize that ... they become like brothers and __sisters."__ some children have lost more than their homeland. some have witnessed one of their parents being killed, or they've been kidnapped and tortured themselves. __kabban,__ who helps run many of the practices, tries to keep the atmosphere serious but fun so that time on the field is a much-needed escape. __"soccer__ is (the) best therapy," __kabban__ said. "they have an hour or two to forget about everything and just be kids." __kabban__ cares deeply because he faced many of the challenges the refugees are __experiencing.__ he was never officially a __refugee,__ but his family left beirut during lebanon's 15-year civil war, a conflict in which three members of his extended family were killed. __kabban's__ family lived in several places -- including the united states, where his father attended college -- before permanently __immigrating__ to the san diego area when __kabban__ was 9. for him, the social adjustment was particularly rough. "i had all the wrong clothes on, and i got made fun of," he said. "they called me __'poor__ __kid.'__ my self-esteem was really, really low." that changed when he discovered american football, scoring a touchdown the first time he got the ball. __"sports__ was the way i got confident, made friends and felt i was like other kids," he said. he went on to earn a football scholarship at baker university, a small private school in kansas where he studied foreign relations. after graduating in 2008, __kabban__ planned to go to egypt to get a graduate degree in refugee studies. but on a visit home that summer, he learned about the large influx of refugees that san diego had experienced in recent years. "i started thinking to myself, 'why am i going halfway across the world to learn about refugees when they're all here in my own __hometown?'__ " he said. instead of going to graduate school, __kabban__ got a job with catholic charities, helping refugees settle into their new lives. he was troubled to see so many children sitting at home, __alienated,__ but he also noticed how they lit up when they saw a soccer ball. one day, he brought a ball with him while making a home visit. as he approached the apartment complex, he heard a boy yell the arabic word for ball. __kabban__ began kicking it around with him, and within minutes, 20 kids had joined the game. that moment gave __kabban__ the inspiration for __yalla's__ approach. although the organization is relatively new, __yalla__ has managed to get funding from local foundations and businesses. everything -- __tutoring,__ soccer and occasional field trips -- is provided at no cost, something the kids __appreciate,__ as nearly all of them know that money is tight at home. __kabban__ has also made it a priority to reach out to those who aren't refugees. when refugees started arriving in the area, there was tension in schools between them, latinos and african-americans. to counteract this, __kabban__ started the __peacebuilders__ league, a soccer league open to everyone in the area. "we wanted to bring them all together and start making a community," he said. "now it looks like the world cup here every sunday." ultimately, __kabban__ hopes to build a __"peace-building"__ charter school for refugees, immigrants and marginalized youth that would use soccer in a formal college prep program. __kabban's__ commitment to the organization is so strong that for more than a year he has worked full-time without a salary, living off his savings. the kids at __yalla__ know he quit his job for them, and they're quick to acknowledge the huge difference he has made in their lives. "i don't know the way (to) say thank you to coach __mark,"__ __yohana__ said. "they helped me to find friends, and they __(taught)__ me how to speak english. ... now, with __yalla__ and coach mark, it's a fun life." stories like that are what push __kabban__ to keep going. "this country gave my family the chance to succeed," he said. "i want to help these kids do the same thing." want to get involved? check out the __yalla__ website at __www.yallasd.com__ and see how to help.

(cnn) -- just west of __seville__ in spain, a sea of giant mirrors is reflecting the sun's energy to provide __"concentrated__ solar power" __(csp)__ while illuminating the path to a new wave of green energy projects. shining __beacon:__ the concentrated solar power plant in __sanlucar,__ spain is the first of its kind. the __624__ carefully positioned mirrors reflect the sun's heat towards a 50 __meter-tall__ central tower where it is concentrated and used to boil water into steam. the __superheated__ steam is then used to turn a turbine that can produce up to 11 megawatts of electricity -- enough power for 6,000 homes -- according __solucar,__ the spanish company that has built the power plant. while traditional solar panels, photovoltaic cells, convert the sun's power directly into electricity, __csp__ focuses power from a wide area and uses the vast heat generated to make electricity in a similar way to that produced from coal or oil. the spanish tower, known as __ps10,__ is the first phase of an ambitious development. by 2013 it is hoped that additional towers will create a __"solar__ __farm"__ with an output of 300 __megawatts,__ which would be enough power for 180,000 homes, or equivalent to the entire population of nearby __seville.__ this $1.5 billion project is the largest commercial __csp__ station in the world -- so far. but many believe the technology will soon take off in areas of continuous hot sun and clear skies, offering a cheaper and more efficient alternative to photovoltaic cells, and bringing jobs and money to __arid,__ often depressed areas. __csp__ also produces no __greenhouses__ __gasses__ and the only pollution is __visual.__ the european union has invested over $31 million in __csp__ research over the last ten years. at least 50 __csp__ projects have been given permission to begin construction across spain. by 2015 the country may be producing two __gigawatts__ of electricity from __csp,__ and employing thousands in the industry. one of the strengths of __csp__ is that it allows the construction of power stations on a scale that can match many fossil fuel based plants, and for an investment far less than that required to install the equivalent __wattage__ of photovoltaic cells. there is also the possibility that production can keep going around the clock -- even when the sun has gone down. __solucar__ is currently testing technology at a plant near granada that will pump 50 percent of the electricity generated in the day into the spanish national grid, and use the other 50 percent to melt salt, which will then act as a kind of battery, storing the sun's power. when dusk falls, the heat stored in the molten salt can be used to generate power through the night. "these technologies excite me," says dr jeff hardy, network manager at the uk energy research council. "one of the real advantages is that you can get a decent sized power plant. "the main challenge with the technology is working with extreme heat, but then a lot of the __back-end__ is very similar to a traditional __fossil-fuel__ __generation;__ you are after all just dealing with water heated to make steam and drive a __turbine."__ concentrating on promoting __csp__ worldwide . as america looks to increase the contribution of renewables to its overall energy mix -- a key part of the obama plan before the recession __turbocharged__ government funding for such "green" infrastructure projects -- the potential of __csp__ technology is obvious. the spanish company responsible for the __sanlucar__ la mayor plant has seen the potential and created __solucar__ power, inc., a subsidiary aiming to develop the market in the usa. there is already a huge solar energy generating __systems'__ __csp__ station in the mojave desert, california; spanish firm __acciona__ has built a plant near las vegas. many more are surely on their way. one bold projection estimates that a single plant 100 miles by 100 miles located in the american south west could generate enough electricity for the whole country. it would obviously be a huge undertaking -- politically, financially and scientifically -- but it's not hard to imagine such a scheme finding a home in the nation's vast, empty quarter. other equally arid areas may also find themselves __transformed,__ and __csp__ may be able to offer valuable foreign earnings for __drought-stricken__ africa -- while giving europe the green energy it needs. according to dr hardy the technology has a ready application, given the right political, environmental and economic context. __"concentrated__ solar power is proven to do well in countries like spain with a favorable government policies and the right __climate,"__ he says. "i can certainly see the potential for extended networks linking together, and the idea of a north african grid linking renewable resources is a real __possibility."__ providing power, jobs and money . the __sahara,__ the world's largest desert, is __fringed__ by some of the poorest countries in the world and the harsh environment has always been seen as a problem, with it's vast, __waterless__ interior regularly reaching temperatures of over 45 degrees __celsius.__ but with large-scale __csp__ projects, suddenly all that empty space, with its year-round clear skies and hot sun, has a value that could transform local economies. it could potentially turn africa into a net exporter of energy to __power-hungry__ europe, and perhaps even do for countries in north africa what oil did for saudi arabia. the sums are __dizzying.__ estimates vary, but one projection from the german aerospace agency puts the amount of solar energy stored in just one per cent of the sahara -- 35,000 square miles, or a piece of land slightly smaller than portugal -- as having the potential to yield more power than all the world's existing power plants combined. already spanish firms are exporting __csp__ technology to morocco and algeria, and a british __consortium,__ the sahara forest project, is testing the technology in the deserts of __oman.__ costs and benefits . however, there is a problem: at the moment costs are still very high. but they are falling as plants get bigger, the technology is perfected and economies of scale kick in. even so, any plans to power europe from the sahara would require a vast infrastructure of __csp__ plants and cables laid across the mediterranean -- requiring billions upon billions of dollars in investment. such sums will only be possible through international co-operation on a huge scale. but on a smaller, more local scale a simple change in the way electricity generators are paid has been hugely effective in boosting renewable power. in spain and other european countries investment has been encouraged by governments creating what's known as a __"feed__ in __tariff,"__ which pays companies a premium for power sold to the national grid generated by renewable means for a fixed period of time. this enables investors to pay back up front costs more quickly. where they have been introduced they have brought about a huge increase in renewable power: germany has 200 times as much solar energy as britain, generates 12 percent of its electricity from __renewables,__ and has created a quarter of a million jobs in the sector. we're a long way from a future where the sahara becomes the world's largest source of renewable electricity, and the american south west is covered in mirrors lighting and powering cities across the continent. there are many huge issues yet to resolve, but with small steps, we may be moving towards it.

washington (cnn) -- a small religious group has lost its fight before the supreme court to erect a granite monument in a utah park next to an existing ten commandments display. __summum,a__ religious group, ____ wanted to place its own monument next to this ten commandments monument. in the free-speech case involving competing faiths, politics and social norms, the justices voted unanimously on wednesday that such privately donated displays on public property represent "government speech" subject to local officials' discretion. __summum,__ a salt lake __city-based__ group, wanted to put up a __3-foot__ granite slab on the "seven __aphorisms__ of __summum"__ in the city of pleasant grove, at the group's expense. local officials argued they should be allowed to decide which permanent displays can be __erected,__ since they would claim ultimate ownership and control. the justices agreed with the city's view. "it is hard to imagine how a public park could be opened up for the installation of permanent monuments by every person or group wishing to engage in that form of __expression,"__ wrote justice samuel __alito.__ at issue was whether donated monuments on public property represent private or government speech. the ruling could affect monuments nationwide, ranging from 9/11 victim tributes to battlefield __markers.__ "it is clear that the monuments in pleasant __grove's__ pioneer park represent government speech," wrote __alito.__ __summum__ argued that by denying it the necessary permit to erect the monument, it was being discriminated against because the existing ten commandments monument was placed there in 1971 by another private group, the fraternal order of __eagles.__ the case dealt only with free speech __constraints,__ not the establishment __clause,__ which prohibits government endorsement of religious faith or doctrine. both are contained in the constitution's first amendment. justice antonin scalia confidently stated that the current ten commandments display in pleasant grove does "not violate any part of the first __amendment...__ the city can safely __exhale."__ not so fast, said brian __barnard,__ __summum's__ lawyer. he notes the case now goes back to lower federal courts, where his group will make a new __argument:__ the city violates the separation of church and state doctrine. "we're going to say the city has adopted clearly religious tenets of __theten__ commandments as their speech," barnard told cnn, "and given this __mounment__ has a prominent display in their public park, it's clearly in violation of the establishment __clause."__ he heads the utah civil rights and liberties foundation. two justices seemed to anticipate the upcoming legal fight. "even if the free speech clause neither restricts nor protects government speech, government speakers are bound by the constitution's other __proscriptions,__ including those supplied by the establishment and equal protection __clause,"__ wrote justices john paul stevens and ruth bader __ginsburg.__ "these constitutional safeguards ensure that the effect of today's decision will be __limited."__ a conservative legal group that represented the utah city hailed the high court ruling. "the decision gives government the right to speak for itself and the ability to communicate on behalf of its citizens," said jay __sekulow,__ chief counsel for the american center for law and justice. "it's a landmark decision that clears the way for government to express its views and its history through the selection of monuments -- including religious monuments and __displays."__ the ruling joins a series of decisions in which the supreme court has refused to offer a broad rule on religious monuments, taking a more __case-specific__ approach. ten commandments displayed in public schools were banned in 1980. but the justices in 2005 allowed a 57-year-old ten commandments granite monument to stay on the texas __statehouse__ grounds, where it stands amid a series of __nonreligious__ __symbols.__ a similar display in kentucky was ordered removed after the high court concluded it violated the separation between church and state. unlike utah, those cases involved efforts to remove the __monuments.__ __summum__ was founded in 1975 by __summum__ __"corky"__ __ra,__ who claimed alien __visitors--__ or __"advanced__ living __beings"--__ revealed the __summum__ concepts to him. he gathered several dozen members and launched a legal fight to erect __monuments.__ he died earlier this year. classified as a tax-exempt church, __summum's__ members prefer to call it a philosophical group. they claim no __over-arching__ doctrine or supreme being, but their movement is extensively laid out in __pamphlets,__ a web site and internet radio __broadcasts.__ on its __one-acre__ compound in salt lake city -- along with a __27-foot-tall__ __copper-shelled__ pyramid -- is a building where the group uses __resins__ and fiberglass in a lengthy rite of __mummification,__ which the group's current leader, su menu, called a key aspect of __summum,__ central to the idea that "the soul moves forward." both humans and pets undergo the procedure. the seven __aphorisms__ are __psychokinesis,__ __correspondence,__ __vibration,__ opposition, __rhythm,__ cause and effect and gender. "all we want to do is share what we have with everyone else. i mean, it's not like __proselytizing,"__ said menu, 53, who is a piano teacher. "not everyone follows the ten __commandments,__ so maybe people are looking for something else, and all we want to do is show them the __possibility."__ pleasant grove, with a population of __30,000,__ lies between salt lake city and __provo.__ pioneer park includes an old __schoolhouse__ and __wagons,__ along with the ten commandments monument, tucked back near a 9/11 memorial placed by a local boy scouts __troop.__ "this park is dedicated to the history of the people, the founding of the city and significant citizens who have lived and contributed to the community," said mayor mike __daniels.__ he said the ten commandments display was allowed because the fraternal order of eagles, ____ which has erected similar monuments in hundreds of other communities since the 1950s, has long-standing ties to the community and performs continuing charity work. a federal appeals court had ruled for __summum,__ concluding parks are a "public __forum"__ to which private groups have access under free-speech protections. alito in his ruling cited several __pop-culture__ references to illustrate how monuments convey __often-competing__ __meanings.__ one included the ad slogan __"beef.__ it's what's for __dinner."__ another included the lyrics to john lennon's 1971 song __"imagine,"__ which he said was made part of a mosaic honoring the late performer in new york's central park.

(cnn) -- google+ has a problem. it's not engagement or the lack of a clear way to __monetize__ itself. it's not those __sometimes-unwieldy__ __friend-organizing__ circles, or even the perception that no one other than nerds uses the service. the problem, its creators believe, is that many people keep comparing it to facebook -- or, more broadly, social networks. while social interaction is a key part of google+, the project is much more ambitious. google+ is nothing short of a wholesale upgrade to all of google's products and services, but with the identity of the user __incorporated.__ mashable sat down with vic __gundotra,__ google's senior vice president of social business, and bradley __horowitz,__ __google+'s__ vice president of product, at the google __i/o__ developer conference. they were excited about the new google+ features that were announced -- the events feature and the new tablet app -- but they were also quick to downplay any comparisons to facebook, or any suggestion that many people aren't interested in joining __google+.__ __"google+__ is just an upgrade to __google,"__ says __gundotra.__ "people have a hard time understanding that. i think they like to compare us with other social competitors, and they see us through that lens instead of really seeing what's __happening:__ google is taking its amazing products, and by bringing them together, they just become more awesome." __gundotra__ and others have said this before, and you get the sense that they really believe in their recipe for __kool-aid.__ google also released some new statistics to __parry__ any __stabs__ at accusing the network of not having a large and engaged audience -- 250 million total users, with 150 million of them visiting every month, and half of those people signing in every day (if you're doing the math, that's 75 million daily active __plussers).__ wading into __google+'s__ stream . but with the definition of google+ so broad, what constitutes "active daily use" becomes a little __hazy.__ if i'm signed into google+ and simply do a google search or upload a photo to __picasa,__ does that __count?__ as google defines the service, it would appear so. however, a user performing such basic google tasks may never visit the stream, __google+'s__ main social feature. that brings the question: just how engaged are google's users with the __stream?__ this week at __i/o,__ __gundotra__ revealed that __"active"__ users of google+ spend an average of 12 minutes in the stream, up from 9 minutes three months ago. still, that's not quite on par with facebook, which sees its users spend a grand total of __10.5__ billion total minutes spent on the network every day, according to its ipo filing. while that becomes about the same 12 minutes if you divide by facebook's 900 million users, remember that we're talking about active users here, so facebook's actual engagement is actually much higher. so since this area is actually where the comparison to facebook is valid, how can google both increase the proportion of active users as well as boost engagement on the __stream?__ "that's a fair question," says __gundotra.__ "i think there we boost engagement by giving people ways to connect things that they care about and are exciting â that nobody else has. like google __hangouts.__ like events. like beautiful __photos."__ horowitz believes as more users __"upgrade"__ to google+ â which essentially just means letting google know who you are â it'll become clear to them that google's many services become much more useful. and at some point they'll find the stream. "when google knows that i'm a man, and i live in this zip code, and i went to this school, and i have these interests, my entire experience gets better," he explains. "you will discover our engagement is massive, and guess what? your friends, family and loved ones are already here. it's not as if we need to acquire users. we just need to bring them into the light." money money money . the way horowitz and __gundotra__ describe it, upgrading to google+ is almost a religious __conversion:__ you weren't really living (i.e. using __google)__ until you make the transition. still, google is a business, and it doesn't undertake massive projects like google+ without some kind of plan to __monetize__ them. so far, google+ doesn't have anything like twitter's trending topics (although it has a "what's __hot"__ stream that's a click or tap away for __users)__ or facebook's sponsored stories. when asked if we might someday see similar features introduced in google+, __gundotra__ wouldn't say, but his change in manner __betrays__ a disdain for how google's competitors incorporate advertising. "our business model is very different," he says. some of our competitors are like going to a baseball stadium. if you have 90,000 people there, you're going to put up ads everywhere, and that's basically the core business model. you're looking at a picture of your daughter, we're going to show you an ad. "we have a very different philosophy. we think the right time to show and ad is when you are at the moment of commercial intent. when __iim__ doing a house __remodel,__ and i'm looking for a microwave __oven,__ then i see bradley's +1 on a ge __appliance,__ that means a lot more to me." __gundotra__ repeated a statistic that google has released before â that when brands use __google+'s__ social extensions in their ads, the __click-through__ rate __(ctr)__ jumps by __5-10%.__ while some have questioned that __statistic,__ the fundamental idea of incorporating recommendations from friends into the ads they're seeing online makes a great deal of sense, and it's the business model of more than one company. still, __gundotra__ won't rule out the possibility of sponsored stories down the road.

"we're very well aware of the opportunity in enterprise. we're not ignoring it. you should expect announcements from us in the future that add unique features that enterprises would need." __google+'s__ long game . to some, google+ made too many __stumbles__ along the way to become a real facebook competitor. as __gundotra__ and horowitz see it, that's the wrong way of looking at it. google+ is simply google's way of taking its many disparate services â search, youtube, maps, etc. â and making them more relevant by incorporating the user's personal data. if some of those services then end up rubbing up against what facebook offers, so be it. in the bigger picture of platforms, though, the comparison is more than appropriate. both facebook and google want you to spend your time on their site, not the __other's.__ facebook began with social interaction and spread to broader services such as messaging. google's taking it the other way around â creating a suite of extremely popular products and then persuading users to get social with them. which approach is better? i don't think there's much question that google's services improve greatly when you add in personal data, be it location, gender, interest or other factors. but the social component is incredibly powerful, and in that aspect facebook is king __(facebook's__ engagement numbers are massive compared to google+ â the stream, __anyway).__ for the longest time, people have been trained to socialize there. it's difficult to imagine a world, even in the long term, where that activity shifts to google. but maybe it doesn't need to. can google+ still be considered a success even if the stream never quite becomes as influential as facebook's news __feed?__ google probably would like to think so, but it's clear that, for now at least, many perceive google+ as a poor man's facebook. and if perceptions are great enough, it has a way of become reality. yep, google+ has a problem.

in the u.s. capitol basement, an auditorium full of congressional staff grapples with the consequences of how their bosses upstairs wrote the affordable care act. starting monday, they will have to choose a health care plan. "a lot of employees are planning to separate because of this," one man stood up and declared at the first-ever congressional orientation for obamacare. by __"separate,"__ he meant quit. it was one of many sharp moments of concern at the two information sessions set up by house administrators thursday. both were closed to the press, but cnn was able to watch on an in-house tv channel. the camera faced the stage, not the audience and staff members who spoke could only be heard, not seen in the broadcast. they did not identify themselves and as a result, we cannot name them. several expressed doubts and fears about leaving their familiar federal employees plan and switching to the exchange, including a little-known but potentially costly issue. "i think the federal government needs to seriously look at whether it is contributing to age discrimination (by forcing staff onto the __exchange),"__ one women said. "the monthly formula for older workers is a serious, serious hit," she went on. "in addition to what i'm paying now, it will be another $300 to $400 a month." under the federal employee health plan, premiums do not vary by age. that's possible because the federal benefits system includes millions of employees and __negotiates__ with insurers for that massive group, spreading out the costs widely. but in the exchange, congress acts as a small business and insurers view it more by individual health needs, charging different premiums for __higher-risk__ staff, like older employees. example: under one __bluecross__ __blueshield__ plan available to congressional staff, the premium for a 20-year-old is __$262.48__ a month, versus __$842.41__ a month for a __60-year-old.__ that's not unique to congressional workers. but it is new for them. compounding the __"hit"__ they feel is how much congress kicks in to help with the __premium,__ its employer __contribution.__ it __maxes__ out at __$426__ a month. the office of personnel management official told cnn that those two things result in much higher premiums for older workers in the exchange than they are paying now under the federal health plan. of course it also means lower relative premiums for younger workers. "you should look into that," one man said at thursday's orientation. the issues for congressional workers are not just __financial.__ some staffers want to select a plan that excludes abortion, "but we've had difficulties figuring out (which one that __is),"__ said one staffer in thursday's first session. "which plans are more __pro-life?"__ asked another at the second session later in the day. in response, insurance company representatives pointed to one __multistate__ plan with __bluecross__ __blueshield__ and all eight plans offered by __aetna.__ more than 100 plans in total are offered to congressional staff. those forced into the exchange have just under a month to pick one, starting monday when the enrollment window set by congressional administrators __opens.__

(cnn) -- the singer gil scott __heron__ once declared that "the revolution will not be __televised."__ __em__ hall, the __"d.c.__ goodwill __fashionista,"__ transformed __goodwill's__ ____ image with a witty blog. it is, however, going online. social activism is being transformed by the web. some of the most creative forms of protest and philanthropy are taking place online. activists are conducting demonstrations on youtube, holding virtual fundraisers and using social network sites like facebook to change the world -- one __mouse-click__ at a time. these __cyber-pioneers__ include a nonprofit group that uses animated 3-d characters to protest the global shortage of drinking water; a web company that allows ordinary people to create their own personalized __charity;__ and a goodwill blogger who __reshaped__ the thrift store's image so thoroughly she was invited to new york fashion week. ted hart, co-author of "people to people __fundraising:__ social networking and web 2.0 for __charities,"__ says the web has already become a crucial source for nonprofit __fundraising.__ americans donated $550 million online in 2001, but that number grew to __$10.4__ billion in 2007, he says. "it's a new world for a lot of nonprofit organizations," hart says. "no longer is it good enough to say give us some money. the rules have changed." yet some people warn that this new world offers people an excuse to engage in __"drive-by__ __activism,"__ superficial forms of __cyber-activism__ that require little commitment. "the internet makes it very easy for people to jump in and out of social __activism,"__ says matthew __hale,__ assistant professor at __seton__ hall university's center for public service. "if all the activism is online, it is easier to quit than going to meetings every week." real change: online or __in-person?__ yet the web makes it easier for a nonprofit group to reach more people than a meeting ever could, one nonprofit group says. __waterpartners__ international is a u.s.-based nonprofit group that created a global campaign to create safe drinking water. another company may have flown a spokesperson to an impoverished village and hired a film crew to promote their campaign. but __waterpartners__ says it saved money and time by putting its campaign online -- through __animated,__ virtual characters built from actual people, says nicole __wickenhauser,__ a company spokesperson. daily web traffic doubled to __waterpartners'__ web site during the campaign and the campaign attracted support from around the globe, __wickenhauser__ says. "real change is most often accomplished by committed individuals working together for a cause they feel passionately about," __wickenhauser__ says. "whether they work together virtually or in person is less important." web-based activism not only __enlarges__ the reach of social activists, it empowers ordinary people, its advocates say. in another time, a person had to find a charity to give their time and money to. now they can create their own charity through web sites like __"yourcause.com."__ __yourcause.com__ has been described as a myspace for __do-gooders.__ the new site allows a person to do everything a charity traditionally does -- raise money and awareness and recruit support -- all from a web page designed especially for their needs. matthew __combs,__ the site's co-founder, says his site designs web pages and vets charities for people who don't have the time or expertise to do it themselves. "it's for people like the 73-year-old woman from new jersey who created her own page to help out with a rare genetic defect she's suffering from," combs says. "there's not a lot of __73-year-olds__ on __myspace.__ how do we make it easy as possible for them, but __credible?"__ social network sites like myspace are also throwing their support behind web activists. myspace has an __"impact"__ page that connects users with political and charitable causes. youtube recently launched a __"nonprofits__ and __activism"__ channel. 'the reaction was __priceless'__ one of the most audacious forms of web-based activism comes courtesy of __em__ hall, also known by her blog name, the dc goodwill __fashionista.__ when goodwill of greater washington wanted to expand its customer base, its leaders devised a campaign to reach out to a younger, __hipper__ crowd. the campaign's centerpiece was hall. in her witty blog, she dispensed fashion advice, conducted an online virtual fashion show and sold goodwill clothing on ebay (she once sold an __$11.98__ suit for $175 on __ebay.)__ hall's blog averages 1,500 readers a week and has attracted readers from at least 100 countries, says brendan __hurley,__ a goodwill spokesman. hall's blog became so popular she was invited in september to fashion week, a high-octane fashion show that features the world's most popular designers. hall still recalls how fashion week officials acted when she told them what clothing label -- goodwill -- she __represented.__ "the reaction was __priceless,"__ she says. "a look of confusion came across people's faces as they desperately tried to figure out why goodwill was at fashion week." despite the possibilities created by the web, calling people to action still depends on people putting their bodies -- not just their __mouse-clicks__ -- on the line, says __hale,__ the __seton__ hall professor. "all of the stuff you can do online ultimately has to show up in the real world," hale says. "i don't see the internet as a substitute [for social __activism]__ but as a complement to it." paul __loeb,__ author of "the soul of a __citizen,''__ a book that examines the psychology of social activism, also says online activism can be powerful but limited. he tells a story from his book to make his point. he says a friend took her kids to a protest against nuclear testing in front of the white house during the early 1960s. but she became __dejected__ because only a few people joined her demonstration and then it __rained.__ years later, the same woman attended a major march against nuclear testing. benjamin __spock,__ the best-selling author and pediatrician who opposed the vietnam war, was a featured speaker. he told marchers that he was inspired to join the march after seeing a small group of women huddled with their kids in the rain while marching in front of the white house years earlier. "i thought that if those women were out there," spock said, "their cause must be really important." "he's seeing these __ragged__ women in the rain and it touches his heart and he ends up getting changed by that," loeb says. "that story couldn't exist in the virtual world."

sydney, australia (cnn) -- robbie moore and matt hastings have been together for six years. as a gay couple, they've watched heterosexual members of their families celebrate their big days wondering if they will ever enjoy their own. but this week could herald the start of a new life for these two __tasmanians:__ married life. in a bold move, the lower house of the tasmanian parliament will introduce the same-sex marriage bill co-sponsored by the ruling labor party and the greens. it is expected to easily pass. the more difficult proposition will be convincing the state's upper house of 15 -- 13 of whom are independents -- to buy the argument of premier lara __giddings,__ that the change will deliver a __aus$100__ million __(us$103__ million) economic boost to the state in gay tourism. if the upper house ticks off on the bill, __tasmania__ will become the first state in australia to legalize same sex marriage. and there's every chance it will quickly be followed by south australia, the northern territory and the australian capital territory. if they succeed, they will join 11 nations where same sex marriage is now legal, including argentina, belgium, canada, spain and norway, along with some u.s. states. new zealand is also likely to pass same sex marriage laws. but as these historic changes blow across australia, the prime minister, julia __gillard,__ and her counterpart in opposition, tony abbott, insist marriage is a vow between a man and a woman. rodney __croome__ begs to __differ.__ he will be among those lining up to marry if the bill passes. "the time for the proposal comes once the law is __passed,"__ he told cnn. "i would love to marry but i think it's only right for me to propose that to the man i love once the law is __passed."__ the face of the gay rights lobby, which in 1997 defeated the tasmanian law that made homosexuality a punishable crime, __croome__ is quietly confident as he acknowledges the challenges. for starters, there's the prospect of a high court challenge to the law, if it passes. "prime minister gillard has not ruled it out," __croome__ said. "this is important. only the commonwealth has the right to challenge a state law. anyone else has to obtain standing before the high court and to do that, they have to show a material disadvantage (as a result of the __law)__ and it's hard to see how anyone -- such as the catholic church or the australian christian lobby could show that," he said. "so if the commonwealth says no, there may not be a challenge at all," he added. between the law passing and any high court challenge, it's anticipated thousands will marry. __croome__ estimates more than 50% of __tasmania's__ same sex couples will rush to the alter and many thousands will flock to __tasmania__ from other australian states and territories to do the same. moore, 30 and __hastings,__ 27, both feel same sex marriage in __tasmania,__ at least, is inevitable. "we have seen the changes happening in the last decade," moore, a union worker told cnn. "even just five years ago, you'd cop it just walking down the streets. but now that people are more socially aware and there's generational change, that paradigm is shifting so i don't get anywhere near as much __slack.__ in fact, i get __encouragement,"__ he said. "having this issue in the media makes people think about it too," said __hastings,__ a __hairdresser.__ for both men, at the heart of the same sex marriage issue is the question of social equality and personal __validation.__ "i grew up in __burnie__ on the __north-west__ coast of __tasmania,__ which was very homophobic and it's been a long journey for me. and there are always the odd few people who are still narrow __minded,"__ said moore. "this is one of the last things that discriminates against gay people," added __hastings,__ referring to the federal marriage act, which deems marriage as an act between a man and a woman. neither man minds if the right to marry each other comes from the tasmanian parliament rather than its federal counterpart. __croome__ agrees. "it's equality in __tasmania,"__ he said. many see it as paving the way for broader change. "some find it odd that it should proceed state by state but in every other federal nation around the world, the movement began at a state level -- canada, the u.s., argentina, __brazil,"__ he said. "so for australia to begin at a state level is not an __anomaly."__ public support for same sex marriage is __patchy__ across australia. but according to __croome,__ in __tasmania__ it is significant. "it took years to reach this level of public support," he said. "some say it's to do with __tasmania's__ convict __past:__ that there were so many men __cooped__ up for so long that the convict era came to be associated with homosexuality and so there was a shame associated with the convict past." whatever the cause of the shift in public thinking, __croome__ is convinced that if the bill passes into law, "it will be an historic moment." for moore it would be a deeply personal affirmation to know that "even in our own conscience, we are equal to others." and for his partner, it would be the moment australia comes of age, tipping its hat to equal rights for all australian -- religious or otherwise. "the important point in this debate is that some people are consumed with the church's beliefs," he said. "but we live in a secular society. i grew up in a catholic family, my mum still attends church and she's a supporter of marriage equality, as are my __godparents."__ whether via state by state stealth or an amendment to the federal marriage act, as rodney __croome__ puts it: "there will be a lot of gay people who are married -- and they will remain __married."__ the federal parliament in the meantime is readying to vote on changes to the marriage act to allow same sex marriage. with only the ruling labor party permitting its members a conscience vote, the chance of change is __miniscule.__

washington (cnn) ____ -- president obama lifted all restrictions monday on the ability of individuals to visit relatives in cuba, as well as to send them __remittances.__ the changes in cuban policy was unveiled before president obama's trip to the summit of the americas. the move represents a significant shift in a u.s. policy that had remained largely unchanged for nearly half a century. it comes days before obama leaves for a key meeting of hemispheric powers, the summit of the americas, in trinidad and __tobago.__ "president obama has directed that a series of steps be taken to reach out to the cuban people to support their desire to enjoy basic human rights and to freely determine their country's future," white house press secretary robert gibbs said. obama also ordered new steps to promote the __"freer__ flow of information among the cuban people and between those in cuba and the rest of the world, as well as to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian items directly to the cuban people," gibbs added. the president took "these steps [in __part]__ to help bridge the gap among divided cuban families." obama believes that the change in u.s. policy will ultimately help bring about a more __tolerant,__ democratic cuban government, noted white house latin american policy adviser dan __restrepo.__ he thinks "that creating independence, creating space for the cuban people to operate freely from the regime is the kind of space they need to start the process toward a more democratic cuba," __restrepo__ said. several key components of america's embargo on the island nation will be __preserved,__ however. among other things, americans will still be barred from sending gifts or other items to high-ranking cuban government officials and communist party members. travel restrictions for americans of __non-cuban__ descent will also remain in place. critics of the change blasted the administration for unilaterally changing what had been a __long-settled__ u.s. policy. president raÃºl castro's __"dictatorship__ is one of the most brutal in the world. the u.s. economic embargo must remain in place until tyranny gives way to freedom and democracy," rep. connie mack, r-florida, said in a written statement. obama "should not make any unilateral change in america's policy toward cuba. instead, congress should vigorously debate these and other ideas before any substantive policy changes are __implemented."__ sen. mel martinez, r-florida, and a native of cuba, had kinder words for the administration, saying, "the announcement today is good news for cuban families separated by the lack of freedom in __cuba."__ he said that, in turn, the cuban government should focus on improving its relationships with its citizens and the united states. __"lowering__ __remittance__ charges and allowing travel for cuban families wishing to see relatives abroad are two steps the cuban regime could immediately take that would show change in __havana,"__ he said. reps. chris smith, r-new jersey, and frank wolf, r-virginia, held a news conference last week urging obama to refrain from easing trade embargo or travel restrictions until the cuban government releases all __"prisoners__ of __conscience,"__ shows greater respect for freedom of religion and speech, and holds "free and __fair"__ elections. "over the past 50 years, the __castros__ and their secret police have been directly responsible for killing thousands of __nonviolent,__ courageous pro-democracy activists and for jailing and torturing tens of thousands of others. and they continue to this day to perpetrate their brutal crimes," smith said. rep. barbara lee, d-california, who chairs the congressional black caucus, responded that it makes no sense to continue what she characterized as a failed policy. ____ watch report on easing of travel restrictions Â» . "everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but by any objective standard, our current policy toward cuba just hasn't worked. simply put, it's time to open dialogue and discussion with cuba," she said in a written statement. lee and other congressional black caucus members met in havana this month with raÃºl castro and his brother, former president fidel castro. several members of congress see broader relations with cuba as vital to u.s. interests. a group of senators and other supporters unveiled a bill march 31 to lift the 47-year-old travel ban to cuba. "i think that we finally reached a new __watermark__ here on this issue," said sen. byron __dorgan,__ __d-north__ dakota, one of the bill's sponsors. sen. richard __lugar,__ __r-indiana,__ another sponsor of the bill, issued a draft report in february that said it was time to reconsider the economic sanctions. lugar is the ranking republican on the senate foreign relations committee. sarah stephens, director of the cuba travel projects and one of the leading advocates pushing for an end to the embargo, said monday that "these are welcome steps, but the right course is to allow all americans to travel to cuba, to open up commerce and to directly engage the cuban government in diplomacy and solving problems in both countries' interests." ____ watch report on whether cuba is ready for u.s. tourists Â» . obama "has a historic opportunity not to be the last president of the cold war but the first president to turn the page in u.s.-cuba relations," she argued. before he was elected president, obama promised to lower some of the barriers in cuban-american relations. provisions attached to a __$410__ billion supplemental budget obama signed in march also made it easier for cuban-americans to travel to cuba and to send money to family members on the island. in addition, they facilitated the permitted sales of agricultural and pharmaceutical products to cuba. the provisions loosened restrictions enacted by president george w. bush after he came to office in 2001. obama's moves appear to be tracking the overall public sentiment on what has historically been a hot-button political issue. __seventy-one__ percent of americans think the united states should re-establish diplomatic relations with cuba, according an april __3-5__ cnn/opinion research corp. poll, and 64 percent think the united states should lift the travel ban to cuba for all americans. sampling error for the poll was plus or minus 3 percentage points.

"the united states believes that a transition in yemen should begin immediately so that the yemeni people can realize their __aspirations,"__ the white house statement said. saleh has voiced agreement with the plan by the __gcc,__ which would ensure his gradual departure from office, but he has not signed it. saleh told brennan that the gcc initiative laid the groundwork for exiting the political crisis through national dialogue involving all political parties, yemen's state-run saba news agency reported. as brennan and saleh met in saudi arabia, clashes erupted between government security forces and armed tribesmen in one of the __epicenters__ of yemen's anti-government movement. two people were killed and at least nine others were injured in the southwestern yemeni city of taiz sunday, medical sources in the city said. dozens of homes were also damaged in the fighting, which started early sunday morning and stretched for more than eight hours, witnesses said. saleh appeared on television in yemen thursday for the first time since the attack, telling viewers he was on the __mend,__ open to talks with opposition forces and determined to strike back at his attackers. his speech from __saudia__ arabia __transfixed__ his home country, which has been enduring months of anti-government protests and al qaeda in the arabian peninsula militant activity. saleh said he had had eight successful surgeries in saudi arabia, but the president, whose badly burned face was dark and who sat __stiffly__ upright in a __buttoned-up__ __robe,__ didn't specify when he would go back to yemen -- a return his supporters anticipate but his opponents hope will never occur. the united states has been aiding yemen's military in its fight against islamic militants amid fears that al qaeda is exploiting the political chaos and leadership vacuum engulfing the unstable and impoverished arabian peninsula country. on sunday, saleh thanked brennan for u.s. support of __"yemen's__ unity, security and stability," according to __saba.__ "he confirmed that yemen needs to be supported and assisted to promote economic and development fields so as to reduce poverty and unemployment, which represent a fertile environment of terrorism," saba reported. cnn's yousuf basil and journalist hakim almasmari contributed to this report.

washington (cnn) -- the top republican on the house oversight committee is moving to hold attorney general eric holder in contempt of congress for failing to cooperate in the panel's investigation of the controversial "operation fast and furious" weapons sting. rep. darrell issa, r-california, sent a __17-page__ memo and a draft contempt resolution to members of his committee thursday, outlining what he argued was justice department's __"refusal"__ to comply with the panel's probe to get information about the sting. the program, run by the bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives, allowed weapons to be purchased illegally in order to track them to senior drug cartel members, but agents lost track of hundreds of weapons in the process. issa indicated the committee may vote on the measure in an upcoming session, setting up a major confrontation between the republican-led house and the obama administration. the justice department firmly rejected the committee's publicly released document. in a letter to issa, deputy attorney general james cole wrote that the department hopes to find a __"mutually__ acceptable __resolution"__ to demands for documents, but issa's resolution "appears to express a preference for confrontation over resolution." __"viewed__ __fairly,__ the disagreements between the committee and the department over the scope of the document to be produced stem not from a lack of cooperation, but from our sincere and unwavering believe that disclosure of materials related to ongoing criminal investigations and prosecutions could well jeopardize our core law enforcement mission, which must remain free from political pressure or even the appearance of political pressure," he wrote. "this is not a novel concept. cole told issa the department has handed over __7,600__ pages of material related to the botched probe, and holder has testified about the issue seven times. but he said the committee needs to better define the types of documents it wants justice to hand over. when word leaked last week that issa was working on such a resolution, the committee's top democrat, rep. elijah cummings, d-maryland, sent the chairman a letter accusing him of pressing the issue for political purposes. "holding someone in contempt of congress is one of the most serious and formal actions our committee can take, and it should not be used as a political tool to generate press as part of an election-year witch hunt against the obama administration," cummings wrote. but in a thursday interview on fox news, issa said, "we're running out of __patience."__ he accused the justice department of a __"coverup,"__ but indicated he was still giving the department a chance to hand over the materials. "if they don't, then i have the support of leadership to do what we have to do," issa said. if the oversight committee approves a contempt resolution, the measure could then go to the house floor for a full vote. but cnn has been told that issa has no firm plans yet to hold a committee vote, hoping instead that the threat will pressure holder to provide the documents the republicans want. "while there are very legitimate arguments to be made in favor of such an action, no final decision has been made about moving forward yet by gop leaders," a senior house gop leadership aide said when asked about the timing of a potential vote in the house on the matter. last week, house speaker john boehner deflected questions on any vote, deferring to issa's investigation. "i continue to support their efforts and believe that this justice department must be held accountable," boehner said. in an effort to paint issa's efforts as politically motivated, a democratic government source noted that issa and other gop lawmakers protested when the house voted to hold bush administration officials in contempt in 2008. but an issa aide said the two issues are completely __different:__ the 2008 dispute involved officials who worked in the white house and claimed executive privilege, the aide said, while issa is seeking information from an agency over which congress has oversight. the committee memo accuses the justice department of __"reckless__ conduct" and notes that it has pressed the department for answers for more than a year about the operation and how it related to the death of border control agent brian terry in 2010. terry was shot near the arizona border by an illegal __immigrant.__ two ak-47s recovered at the scene were traced back to a database of weapons bought by a straw __purchaser__ and then smuggled into mexico in an operation that resulted in the loss of hundreds of weapons. after terry's death, the justice department initially denied allegations in a letter to congress that it was illegally allowing the flow of weapons to members of mexican drug rings. but it acknowledged the program about a year later, calling it __"fundamentally__ __flawed."__ holder has since vowed that guns will not be allowed to __"walk"__ from gun shops near the border with mexico. in february, holder told congress the justice department was still doing its internal inquiry, but stated that officials could be fired for improper conduct. "i can assure you those people will be removed from federal service," he __vowed.__ issa's memo notes that while the justice department has provided some materials to capitol hill, most of the information about "fast and furious" came though whistle-blowers and media reports. the oversight committee approved a subpoena sent to holder in october 2011 with 22 categories of documents it wanted to see, but the committee says it has only received materials relating to 12 of those categories. "for over a year, the department has issued false __denials,__ given answers intended to __misdirect__ investigators, sought to intimidate witnesses, unlawfully withheld subpoenaed documents, and waited to be confronted with __indisputable__ evidence before acknowledging uncomfortable facts," the memo states. cole said justice has provided more documents to its inspector general's office, which is conducting its own investigation of "fast and __furious."__ and cited internal legal opinions dating back to the reagan administration to argue against disclosing some documents to congress. specifically, the committee is pressing for documents that shed light on why the justice department first denied and then acknowledged the program. it also wants more information on which senior justice department officials knew about the operation and who approved it, as well as why the various law enforcement agencies allegedly failed to communicate with each other about the operation. issa's committee has been holding a joint investigation with the top republican on the senate judiciary committee, sen. chuck grassley, __r-iowa.__ grassley said he supported issa's move to press for a contempt resolution, and urged the justice department to "come __clean."__ "the attorney general and the justice department are __thumbing__ their nose at the constitutional authority provided to the legislative branch to conduct __oversight,"__ grassley said in a written statement. the controversy over the operation has prompted some gop members on the hill to call for holder's resignation, and more than 100 house republicans signed onto a resolution of "no confidence" against the attorney general -- a largely symbolic gesture that is less serious than a contempt resolution.

a beloved roman catholic priest was found dead wednesday in his church's __rectory,__ spurring police to launch a murder investigation and those he touched to try to make sense of his sudden passing. __eureka,__ california, police chief andy mills said officers -- responding to a call from staff at st. bernard church -- first came across the victim around 9 a.m. wednesday. he did not elaborate on how the death occurred, adding wednesday night that there were no suspects. mayor frank __jager__ identified the victim as the rev. eric freed, whom he called a personal friend and a "tremendous person in this community" since his arrival three years ago. the st. bernard parish website featured a cross and the words, "rest in peace," above __freed's__ name. "he was a really, genuinely warm individual," said professor stephen __cunha,__ the chairman of __humboldt__ university's religious studies department where freed taught for more than 10 years.

"i cannot tell you how proud and honored i am to be your __pastor,"__ freed wrote in a letter posted on the parish website. "our parish is alive, joyful and full of faith, hope and charity that define us as catholic __christians."__ while he was relatively new to st. __bernard,__ freed had already made an impact there and elsewhere around __eureka__ -- including with the city's __japanese-american__ community, as freed lived in japan for many years -- __jager__ told reporters. "this is an absolutely tremendous loss not only for the st. __bernard's__ parish, but for our community __generally,"__ the mayor said. "for those of us who believe in prayer, this is the time for that." his ties to __humbodt__ state went back even longer. a guest __lecturer,__ freed wrote a book about the first atomic bomb and also taught about the new __testament,__ connecting with christians and __non-christians__ alike. "he was very well respected, very well liked and had a tremendous working knowledge as well as academic knowledge," __cunha__ said.

"my stomach still turns today at the thought of fellow americans paying terrorists," __julin__ said. "it just makes my stomach sick." __chiquita,__ which has admitted making payments to the rebels and was fined $25 million by the u.s. justice department, says it was __victimized.__ __"chiquita__ __acquiesced__ to extortion payments to protect the lives of its employees," company spokesman ed __loyd__ said. to some analysts, the issue highlights the difficulties of conducting business in war-torn areas. marxist guerrillas who call themselves the armed revolutionary forces of colombia, commonly known as farc, declared war on the government in 1964. chiquita had more than 200 banana farms in colombia before selling them in 2004. "it's really tough doing business in an environment that is lawless and the state is largely __absent,"__ said bruce __bagley,__ professor of international studies at the university of miami. for __julin,__ though, the issue is deeply personal. she had been married to mark rich for __3Â½__ years when farc rebels burst into their home in __pucuro,__ panama, across the border from colombia, on january 31, 1993. the rebels abducted rich while his wife and two daughters -- ages 11 months and 2Â½ years -- watched in horror. the farc abducted two other members of the new tribes mission around the same time and demanded a $5 million ransom for the three men about a week later. one year later, the rebels abducted two other missionaries belonging to the same christian group. a $3 million ransom was demanded for their release. no ransom was paid for any of them. the families did not know anything about their loved ones for years. it was a tough time for __julin's__ daughters. "they went through all of their __growing-up__ years that they can remember asking where their daddy was and if he could come home for their __birthdays,"__ __julin__ said. she and the wives of the other men abducted in 1993 found out the truth in december 2000, when new tribes mission officials told them the farc had killed the three captives in 1996. the colombian government confirmed the deaths in february 2007. the two men who were abducted in 1994 were killed during a firefight between the farc and the colombian military in june 1995. evidence and eyewitness reports obtained by the colombian national prosecutor's office and the u.s. justice department confirmed that the farc executed the __missionaries.__ the u.s. state department designated the farc a foreign terrorist organization on october 8, 1997. the five widows found out another hurtful truth in march 2007, when chiquita pleaded guilty to violating u.s. __antiterrorism__ laws by providing payments to another colombian terrorist organization, the paramilitary right-wing united self-defense forces of colombia, known as the __auc.__ chiquita made more than 100 payments to the __auc__ totaling at least $1.7 million, the justice department said. as part of those proceedings, chiquita acknowledged that it had also made payments to the farc from 1989 to at least 1997. that period included the span during which the five missionaries were abducted and killed. that knowledge still pains __julin.__ "i just can hardly stand to think about it too much," she said. "they're like a household name. you feel like you can trust them. "it's just horrible to think about." __chiquita's__ __loyd__ said the company's sole motivation was to protect the lives of its employees. he cited a 1995 incident in which a bus transporting chiquita employees was attacked and 25 people aboard it died. in total, he said, more than 50 chiquita employees were killed in colombia in the 1990s. "we're sympathetic to the families," he said, "but chiquita was being __extorted__ by right-wing groups and left-wing groups. there was a very real fear, a very real threat to u.s. citizens." that argument does not wash with gary m. __osen,__ an attorney for the families. "there's no law that says you have to operate in areas where you have to pay terrorists," __osen__ said. "that's something they chose to do." __julin,__ a 40-year-old kindergarten teacher at a church school near orlando, florida, filed suit in march 2008. civil provisions of the u.s. anti-terrorism act of 1991 allow american citizens, their heirs and their estates to be paid compensation for injuries suffered as a result of international terrorism. the families __"allege__ that __chiquita,__ knowing that farc was a terrorist organization, intentionally agreed to provide money, weapons and services to it as part of a common scheme to subvert local trade unions, protect __chiquita's__ farms and __shipments,__ harm __chiquita's__ competitors, [and] strengthen __farc's__ military capabilities, and that [the __families]__ were injured by overt acts done in __furtherance__ of the common __scheme,"__ u.s. district judge kenneth a. __marra__ wrote in his __34-page__ ruling allowing the suit to go forward. court records show that chiquita initially made monthly cash payments to the farc ranging from $20,000 to $100,000. eventually, __chiquita's__ payments were fixed to a percentage of the company's gross revenues from its colombia banana business. ultimately, up to 10 percent of those revenues were diverted to the farc. the company also supplied weapons, ammunition and other supplies to the rebels, the victims' families allege. the families also said __"chiquita__ went to great lengths to hide its relationship with __farc,"__ __marra__ noted in the february 4 ruling. "the payments were often delivered by a former american military pilot known as __'kaiser,'__ who held a management position with chiquita in __colombia,"__ the judge said the families allege. according to the families, __marra__ said, chiquita placed false names and nonexistent employees on its __payroll,__ providing the money on local __paydays__ to regional farc commanders. the company also helped the farc create front organizations to which chiquita could channel money, the victims' families said. in addition, the judge said, the families accuse chiquita of working with __farc-controlled__ labor unions as another way to channel payments to the __guerrillas.__ chiquita spokesman __loyd__ and one of the company's attorneys, jonathan m. __sperling,__ declined to discuss friday whether the families' allegations noted by __marra__ are __factual.__ the judge's ruling means the case can go to the discovery phase, in which each party can obtain documents and evidence from the other side. "we needed to pass this hurdle in order to go forward," said steven m. __steingard,__ another attorney for the families. __loyd__ expressed confidence that the company will be __exonerated.__ "it makes no sense to make chiquita or chiquita employees liable for the horrible crimes that those groups committed," __loyd__ said. said __osen,__ the attorney for the other side, __"chiquita__ is intent on defending what we consider the __indefensible."__ no amount for monetary damages has been asked, __osen__ and __steingard__ said. __julin,__ who has __remarried,__ says she has a reason beyond dollars and cents. "all those years of not knowing if he was alive or dead," she said. "there never has been any __closure."__

although it's been in the works -- and riled __alarmists__ __(whoopi__ goldberg had some choice words to share back in __may)__ -- for a while, new york city's __"latch__ on __nyc"__ initiative, which will be put into practice in 27 of the city's 40 hospitals beginning on september 2, has caught a recent wave of inflammatory __flack__ among various __'news'__ sources, mom bloggers, and more. __nyc's__ mayor bloomberg announced the initiative shortly after the __aap__ released its new breastfeeding recommendations, which cite an ever-growing body of data supporting __breastfeeding's__ benefits to babies, moms, and the economy, and stressed __hospitals'__ important role in this picture. his initiative also followed the public appeal of dozens of consumer and health organizations, to hospitals, to stop doling out corporate formula __swag__ bags to every new mom they __discharge.__ __breastfeeding's__ health benefits are __indisputable,__ as are its dismal rates among american __moms.__ parenting.com: 15 toddler __superfoods__ . on the __up-side,__ however, studies have shown repeatedly that exposure to information about breastfeeding increases __moms'__ desire to give it a __whirl.__ and early, hands-on support __(followed__ by a supportive workplace and public __sphere)__ helps make it really happen. since us health officials hope to almost double the nursing count by 2020, hospitals seem like the logical place to start. it surprises me that latch on nyc has received such vocal criticism. and frankly, much of the recent criticism is based more in the alleged __"breastfeeding__ __debates"__ and their crossfire than in, you know, reality. more on that in a minute. first, here's the latch on nyc plan: in addition to a __pro-breastfeeding__ public transport poster campaign (not the first in the country by any __means),__ voluntarily complying hospitals __will:__ . - enforce the new york state hospital regulation to not supplement breastfeeding infants with formula unless medically indicated and documented on the infant's medical __chart-__ limit access to infant formula by hospital __staff-__ discontinue the distribution of promotional or free infant __formula-__ prohibit the display and distribution of infant formula advertising or promotional materials in any hospital location . what this means __is:nurses__ must document the dispensing of formula to new moms, citing a medical reason for its necessity. i.e. nurses will need to actually talk with new moms, and provide them with information and support in trying to __breastfeed__ before they hand out formula. given the difficulty i had in getting any breastfeeding support after my nyc hospital delivery, i would have welcomed some policy backing my requests. but for new moms who just plain don't want to __breastfeed,__ this definitely represents a change of __tides...__ not by much, though. no one will be forced to __breastfeed__ if they truly don't want to, __obviously.__ parenting.com: best cities for families . this policy provides an official way to hold hospitals accountable, rather than to condemn women's choices. in fact, the initiative clearly states that __"mothers__ who decide to formula feed and cannot afford formula will be referred to __wic__ __(women,__ infants and __children),__ a food and nutrition program for low-income families." i.e. the government is still giving out free formula to those who want to feed it to their babies but can't afford to buy it. this is hardly an __anti-formula-feeding__ campaign. (but it definitely is a __pro-breastfeeding__ __one).__ next up, limiting formula access means only that there'll be an extra step between a mom delivering her baby and a nurse handing her formula. namely, the mom will need to ask for it. again, i read this as a way to hold hospitals accountable for attending to each patient personally. finally, __discontinuing__ corporate __swag__ __(promotional__ materials and actual __formula)__ is a big deal, and a huge step. __karol__ __markowicz's__ (of the new york __post)__ opinion that "a mother isn't going to choose to feed her baby formula because she got a free __lanyard__ or __tote__ __bag"__ notwithstanding, the fact is that corporations are, by definition, the opposite of charitable __organizations;__ they vie for access to new moms __in-hospital__ because, a) brand loyalty is not to be __underestimated,__ and b) mothers assume hospitals have their patients' (i.e. the moms and babies they care __for)__ best interests at heart. parenting.com: 36 tips for breastfeeding success . so if a given formula is provided -- along with __"informational__ __literature"__ -- actually in the hospital, that formula must be, by __affiliation,__ a __baby's-best-interest__ choice. (it's a __subconscious,__ logical __conclusion.)__ of course babies can, and do, thrive on formula, but there's no debate in the medical field as to breast __milk's__ nutritional __superiority.__ by providing education and support around __breastfeeding,__ and removing formula manufacturers from the picture, hospitals are actually operating with increased professional __integrity;__ they are actually providing the best possible care to patients. and in some cases, this will mean providing formula to __babies...__ is it really so horrible that this won't come with a bunch of pr from __nestle?__ __no.as__ far as the controversy and crossfire is concerned, the post's __karol__ __markowicz,__ despite her __anything-but-objective__ objections to the initiative, made one __apt,__ if __obnoxiously-presented,__ point in her __critique.__ lisa __paladino,__ of staten island university hospital, had been quoted in this other post article, explaining that under the new system, a nurse will need to sign out each bottle of formula issued. __markowicz__ writes, "perhaps __paladino__ has never been around a hungry infant, but she should anticipate a cacophony of screams while perpetually __understaffed__ hospitals find nurse's aides to sign out formula like it's __morphine."__ while her analogy is rather __unhinged,__ her point about __understaffing__ is __important;__ i was really kind of freaked out, __post-delivery,__ by how little the nurses seemed to care for -- or even check on -- ____ my well-being. when the __'nurse__ __button'__ proved __pointless,__ i ended up __hobbling__ down the hallway, __barefoot,__ in search of a glass of drinking water. i was, meanwhile, nervous about my own abilities with a __newborn,__ and the lack of nurse oversight made me afraid that if my baby needed something while with me in my room __(something__ even more urgent than breastfeeding support, which definitely wasn't __forthcoming),__ there wouldn't be a good way to get medical __help...__ in a hospital. yeah. i know my breastfeeding experience -- and entire __post-delivery__ experience -- would have been improved with better __post-natal__ care, along with one-on-one breastfeeding help. bloomberg's initiative, along with the recent research pointing to the crucial role that hospitals play in breastfeeding success, will hopefully motivate hospitals to equip themselves with adequate nursing staffs in order to really attend to helping new moms get their __bearings__ -- around __breastfeeding,__ and otherwise. if they don't, this plan could __backfire.__ but if they do, and it __succeeds,__ it could prove to be a positive model for hospitals to follow, __nation-wide.__ parenting.com: the most awkward pregnancy photos ever . for her part, __markowicz__ has little else to offer. she __dubs__ bloomberg's initiative an __"anti-formula__ __crusade"__ and writes that breastfeeding hardly needs a __policy-backed__ __boost,__ __stating,__ "a mere 50 years ago, 75 percent of american infants were using __formula;__ breastfeeding was the odd way to feed a child." true, but fifty years ago -- 1962 -- was not exactly a progressive time in american history, particularly for women and __babies:__ __thalidomide__ for morning __sickness?__ twilight sleep __births?__ __hello?__ __markowicz__ has cited the least natural point in mainstream american birth practices as a way to ostensibly __'naturalize'__ formula __feeding's__ prime place in our hospitals today. it's a flimsy argument, and a strange __respose__ to a __(voluntary)__ change in policy here in __2012.those__ who are kicking up __(badly-written,__ and poorly __supported)__ dust around latch on nyc are fueling negativity for its own sake, as well as __divisiveness__ for the sake of attention (and page views, which add up to advertising __sales).__ let's not get sucked in. at the end of the day, the __post-delivery__ hospital stay is, under normal circumstances, quite brief. a couple of days won't keep __formula-minded__ moms from feeding their babies formula. but it can make all the difference in getting moms who want to __breastfeed__ onto a successful track. and greater numbers of successfully breastfeeding babies will make for a healthier population of babies, and moms, overall. this is a fact. this is why bloomberg jumped in to this incredibly controversial territory -- breastfeeding issues and corporate interests in health care __(wow,__ __double-whammy)__ -- in the first place. getting swept up in demonizing him, or in any uproar around this new policy, __distracts__ from what the initiative really means for new moms (more __support)__ and for hospitals __(step__ it __up).it's__ going to be __okay!__ it's not 1962 anymore. what do you think of the latch on nyc __initiative?__ what do you think all the uproar is really about?

los angeles (cnn) -- the promoter for michael jackson's comeback concerts expressed doubts about the star's ability to be ready for the shows but expressed confidence in the private doctor eventually convicted in jackson's death, according to e-mails published in sunday's los angeles times. aeg live president randy phillips was responding to "this is it" director kenny __ortega's__ e-mail, which said jackson had "strong signs of paranoia, anxiety and __obsessive-like__ behavior" and suggesting they hire a "top psychiatrist in to evaluate him __asap."__ jackson died on june 25, 2009, from what the los angeles county coroner ruled was an overdose of a surgical anesthetic and __sedatives,__ drugs that dr. conrad murray told police he used to help the entertainer sleep as he prepared for the concerts set to start two weeks later. murray was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced to four years in prison last year. the e-mails, leaked to the newspaper, were gathered for an insurance company's lawsuit, which seeks to void a __$17.5__ million policy that aeg live purchased in case jackson was not able to perform the 50 shows scheduled for london's o2 arena. the newspaper did not disclose the source of the leaks. __lloyds__ of london contends aeg live hid jackson's health problems from the insurer and failed to respond to repeated requests for his medical history. katherine jackson explains disappearance . while phillips called jackson's death "a terrible __tragedy"__ in an e-mail weeks after he died, he added "but life must go on." __"aeg__ will make a fortune from __merch__ sales, ticket __retention,__ the touring exhibition and the __film/dvd,"__ phillips wrote. in fact, aeg live was allowed to sell jackson tour merchandise and share in the profits from the documentary "this is it," produced from rehearsal video. aeg live and its lawyer did not immediately respond to a cnn request for comment. the e-mails suggest aeg live's president saw jackson's problems first hand the day the pop star was to appear at the o2 arena to publicly announce the shows. __"mj__ is locked in his room drunk and __despondent,"__ phillips wrote in a march 5, 2009, e-mail to aeg live's parent company, the paper reported. "i __(am)__ trying to sober him up." "i screamed at him so loud the walls are __shaking,"__ phillips wrote. "he is an emotionally paralyzed mess riddled with self __loathing__ and doubt now that it is show time." the promoter blamed london traffic when jackson was 90 minutes late for the announcement that day. "he's as healthy as he can be -- no health problems whatsoever," phillips told cnn two months later to refute reports jackson's health was threatening the concerts. the los angeles times story, however, said the e-mails indicated major doubts about jackson's ability to perform. "we cannot be forced into stopping this, which __mj__ will try to do because he is lazy and constantly changes his mind to fit his immediate wants," aeg live executive paul gongaware e-mailed to phillips. jackson's missed rehearsals in june triggered concerns in e-mails that he was slow in learning his dance routines and would have to __lip-sync__ on stage, the newspaper reported. __"mj__ is not in shape enough yet to sing this stuff live and dance at the same time," one e-mail from the show's music director read, the paper reported. a production manager wrote: "he was a basket case. doubt is __pervasive."__ despite __'unity'__ concert, family in uproar . a loud warning from ortega, who worked closely with jackson on previous tours, came in __mid-june,__ just over a week before his death. "it is like there are two people there. one __(deep__ __inside)__ trying to hold on to what he was and still can be and not wanting us to quit him, the other in this weakened and troubled state," ortega wrote. "i believe we need professional guidance in this matter." ortega testified at murray's trial about his concerns about jackson's frail condition and missed __rehearsals.__ it resulted in a meeting six days before jackson's death in which murray assured the promoters he would have jackson ready for rehearsals that next week. an e-mail from phillips after that meeting said he had confidence in murray "who i am gaining immense respect for as i get to deal with him more." "this doctor is extremely successful (we check everyone out) and does not need this __gig,__ so he (is) totally unbiased and __ethical,"__ phillips' e-mail said. murray seeks new test in __mj's__ death . the correspondence could play a role in a wrongful death lawsuit filed by jackson's heirs against __aeg,__ which accuses the promoter of contributing to his death by pressuring him to prepare for the concerts despite his weak condition. a lawyer for jackson's mother and a spokesman for jackson's estate declined to comment on the e-mails reported in the newspaper. cnn's denise quan contributed to this report.

"it reflects the stark reality of what we've inherited -- a trillion dollar deficit, a financial crisis, and a costly __recession,"__ he said. obama said his administration already has identified $2 trillion in government spending cuts that can be made over the next decade. ____ see video highlights of the speech, issue by issue Â» . the president touted the $787 billion stimulus plan he signed into law last week, saying it will invest in areas critical to the country's economic recovery. he also made bold promises for what these investments will achieve. obama predicted that because of the recovery plan, the united states will double its supply of renewable energy in the next three years. he also said the country will invest $15 billion a year to develop technology for green energy. ____ grade obama's speech Â» . obama also pledged a "historic __commitment"__ to health care and said the recovery plan could lead to a cure for cancer. he also promised the __"largest__ investment ever" in preventive care. on education, obama set a goal of having the highest college graduation rate in the world by 2020. he pointed to the billions for education -- from early childhood education expansion to __college-loan__ programs -- in the economic stimulus package to ensure that every child has access to education "from the day they are born to the day they begin a career." obama also said his budget will pay for more soldiers and marines, increase their pay and expand veterans health care and benefits. ireport.com: did obama really __deliver?__ obama said the recovery plans already in the works are immediate steps to revive the economy in the __short-term,__ "but the only way to fully restore america's economic strength is to make the long-term investments that will lead to new jobs, new industries, and a renewed ability to compete with the rest of the world." __"slowly,__ but surely, confidence will return, and our economy will __recover,"__ he said, asking congress to join him in "doing whatever proves necessary because we cannot __consign__ our nation to an open-ended __recession."__ obama promised to reform the regulatory system to "ensure that a crisis of this magnitude never happens again." the president also signaled that he was willing to take on __entitlements,__ saying that congress must take on the growing costs of medicare and social security. obama described the nation's financial woes as a __"reckoning"__ for poor decisions made by both government and individuals. ____ watch what obama says about the "day of __reckoning"__ Â» . "a surplus became an excuse to transfer wealth to the wealthy instead of an opportunity to invest in our future," obama said. __"regulations__ were gutted for the sake of a quick profit at the expense of a healthy market. people bought homes they knew they couldn't afford from banks and lenders who pushed those bad loans anyway. and all the while, critical debates and difficult decisions were put off for some other time on some other day." noting that is easy to "become cynical and __doubtful,"__ obama said he has learned that "hope is found in unlikely places." obama avoided lofty rhetoric and instead used examples of specific people to __personalize__ his points. __abess__ is a bank president from miami, florida, who reportedly cashed out of his company, took a $60 million bonus and distributed it among people who had worked for him. __bethea__ is an __eighth-grade__ girl from south carolina who, in a letter to lawmakers, asked for help for her school and said, "we are not __quitters."__ ____ watch obama talk about __bethea__ saying "we are not __quitters"__ Â» . while the economy was the focus of the speech, obama also touched on foreign policy. the president said he'll soon be laying out specifics on how to win the war in afghanistan and end the one in iraq. "we are now carefully reviewing our policies in both wars, and i will soon announce a way forward in iraq that leaves iraq to its people and responsibly ends this war," he said. ____ watch the entire speech Â» . meanwhile, he said, both afghanistan and its border with pakistan will remain a key focus. because obama's presidency is just a month old, the speech is not technically considered a state of the union address. the annual state of the union speech is delivered in the house of representatives before members of both the house and the senate as well as the justices of the supreme court, the president's cabinet and international __dignitaries.__ cnn's kristi keck contributed to this report.

(cnn) -- the reactions to ariel castro's death have ranged from tears to calling him a coward to demands for an investigation. but the three women who suffered in his control for about decade remained silent. michelle knight, georgina dejesus and amanda berry have not said a word about castro's death. the man who snatched them off the street, chained them in his house and raped them repeatedly, was found hanged in an ohio prison tuesday. while there were strong opinions about castro from many, a spokeswoman said wednesday the three women would not make a statement. maria __castro-montes,__ castro's cousin, said she cried when she heard the news and immediately thought of the victims. would they be glad or angry about castro's death? "i just hope these victims can move past this now. i know they wanted him to live out a life sentence, but really, was he suffering behind __bars?"__ she said.

"he was housed in protective custody which means he was in a cell by himself and rounds are required every 30 minutes at staggered __intervals,"__ __joellen__ smith of the corrections department said in a statement. "a thorough review of this incident is under way," she added. at least two investigations will be done, according to another corrections department statement. the prison director commissioned a review team, to be made up of legal, medical, mental health, security and operational professionals not directly involved in the incident, to analyze castro's death. __'hope__ for __everyone,'__ __ex-captive__ says before house demolished . but castro attorney, craig __weintraub,__ said more precautions against a possible suicide should have been taken. castro's attorneys had requested permission for an independent forensic psychologist to evaluate their client, but were denied by officials, he said. if castro was believed to be __suicidal,__ he should have been under stricter protection, he said. some will see his death as "a happy ending to this story, and a quick ending and __justifiable,"__ __weintraub__ said. "but we're in a civilized society and no one should really be celebrating this." no place in the world . in handing down a sentence last month, judge michael russo told the kidnapper there was no place in the world for his brand of criminal. castro pleaded guilty to __937__ counts, including murder and kidnapping, in exchange for the death penalty being taken off the table. the charges stem from his kidnapping, rape and assault of knight, abducted in __2002;__ dejesus, abducted in __2004;__ and __berry;__ abducted in 2003. castro is the father of berry's 6-year-old daughter. castro's victims resilient after years of abuse . all three women kept diaries with castro's permission, providing many of the details of their abuse.

(cnn) -- glance at floyd __mayweather's__ complex life story and it's hard not to be reminded of the lyrics to sly and the family stone's classic song: "it's a family __affair"__ --- __"blood's__ thicker than the mud, it's a family __affair."__ to start with there is the __boxer's__ relationship with his father, which has such a degree of bad blood that even __psychoanalyst__ __sigmund__ __freud__ might have trouble exploring the demons that have been unleashed between father and son. in may, the pair were professionally reunited for the first time in 13 years as floyd sr. worked the corner during his son's successful welterweight title defense against robert __guerrero.__ the intervening years had been characterized by bitter rows and public __slanging__ matches as the __mayweathers__ fell out to such extent that floyd sr. once told reporters he did not even know the names of two of his grandchildren. but as the man nicknamed __"money"__ returned to the ring for the first time since serving a two-month jail term for a domestic violence conviction, he enlisted the help of his father. the official reason for his return two months ago was that the __five-division__ world champion's regular trainer -- floyd __sr.'s__ brother roger -- was too __debilitated__ by diabetes to be relied upon. mayweather sr. had last taken charge of __floyd's__ corner in 2000 prior to being booted out of his son's house, and life, shortly after. defensive __nous__ . a notable feature of floyd jr.'s unanimous points decision over guerrero, the __wbc's__ interim champion while mayweather was in prison, became the fact that he had tightened up his defense -- a product of his father's work, the fighter says. "my dad is a remarkable trainer, a defensive __wizard,"__ the man with the __44-0__ record told cnn in an exclusive interview. "my dad brings everything. it all started with my father. what's been installed in me from the beginning is the less you get hit, the longer you last in the sport. my father was right." floyd sr. knows about the importance of avoiding major injury all too well. he has frequently recounted how he was shot in the leg by tony sinclair -- the later brother of floyd jr.'s mother -- in 1978 . "i got shot early in my career with a 20 gauge __shotgun,"__ floyd sr. has said. "and i was holding my son when i got shot. floyd was one at the time." floyd sr. was holding his son during the shooting incident to ensure he was not hit in the face or upper body - a move that he believes saved his life. "i wasn't going to put that baby down," floyd sr. told the los angeles times in 2012. "i didn't want to die. it wasn't about putting my son in the line of fire. i knew __[sinclair]__ wouldn't shoot the baby. so he took the gun off my face, lowered it to my leg and __bam!"__ floyd jr.'s defensive skills are such that he has long been known as "pretty boy" because of the fact he has boxed his many bouts so well his face has been largely __unblemished.__ "it was basically for not taking any punishment," said floyd jr. "you know, i can't be over the age of 30 calling myself __'pretty__ __boy'.__ i'm a man." his fight against guerrero was the first of a __six-part__ deal with __showtime,__ with every bout worth at least __$32m__ to a sportsman named as the highest __earner__ by forbes magazine for 2012. when he signed the __30-month__ deal in february, the 36-year-old mayweather said it would be his last as a professional fighter and that he would be retiring when the contract ended. but he seems to have had a change of heart given comments he made on monday while promoting his next fight -- against 22-year-old mexican sensation saul __"canelo"__ alvarez in september. "after my five more fights, guess what? i think after __(getting__ to) __49-0__ we may stay in this sport a little longer," mayweather told a crowd some 5,000 strong at the alamo in san antonio. there has been speculation that __mayweather's__ decision to recall his father reveals a desire to finally bury the __hatchet,__ with the 60-year-old suffering from the lung disease __sarcoidosis.__ when asked by cnn what he had learnt from his time in jail, a sentence earned after he assaulted his former partner __josie__ harris -- the mother of two of his children -- in 2010, mayweather gave the following reply. "never take anything for granted. as far as ... you could see a person here today and gone tomorrow. so never take anything for granted," he said. family harmony . mayweather learnt his boxing skills from his father, a former fighter who was stopped by sugar ray leonard in 10 rounds in 1978, until floyd sr. was given a __five-and-a-half-year__ jail term for drug trafficking when his son was 16. it meant he was absent for the bronze medal his son won at the 1996 olympics in atlanta and the start of his professional career later that year. floyd sr. trained his son upon his release from prison in 1998 but the pair fell out soon after, with their last fight taking place in 2000 as the then junior lightweight champion defended his title. __floyd's__ uncle roger -- who won two titles himself in the 1990s -- took charge but there is little lost between the siblings, even if floyd jr may be trying to change this in what may prove to be his toughest fight so far. "he figures he can __(bring__ us __together)__ by having us in the corner together," roger told __mlive.com__ in april. "that's the only thing i can think of. all this time, __floyd's__ been with me, the whole time he's __boxed.__ so for it to be something else, it's something that he's trying to __mend."__ and recent comments from floyd jr. do nothing to dispel the notion that a man whose career is built upon effective violence is trying to bring harmony to a warring boxing dynasty. "the arguments we had in the past or the differences my dad and my uncle had in the __pastÃ¢â¬âthat's__ the past," mayweather, who is often labeled the world's best __pound-to-pound__ boxer, said in may. "that's why we call it the past because we try to leave that in the past and focus on the future and the future should be __bright."__

a beloved roman catholic priest was found dead wednesday in his church's __rectory,__ spurring police to launch a murder investigation and those he touched to try to make sense of his sudden passing. __eureka,__ california, police chief andy mills said officers -- responding to a call from staff at st. bernard church -- first came across the victim around 9 a.m. wednesday. he did not elaborate on how the death occurred, adding wednesday night that there were no suspects. mayor frank __jager__ identified the victim as the rev. eric freed, whom he called a personal friend and a "tremendous person in this community" since his arrival three years ago. the st. bernard parish website featured a cross and the words, "rest in peace," above __freed's__ name. "he was a really, genuinely warm individual," said professor stephen __cunha,__ the chairman of __humboldt__ university's religious studies department where freed taught for more than 10 years. "... kind is the word that comes to mind, __sensitive."__ noting that students at the state university loved freed -- who was also deeply involved in that school's catholic student group, the newman center -- __cunha__ added: "this was not some __stuffy__ __clergyman.__ he was very much someone that you could sit down and speak __with...__ "he connected with everybody." local and state authorities remained at st. bernard church -- one of two in the coastal northern california city situated 275 miles north of san francisco where he was the sole pastor -- late wednesday processing the crime scene and following up on tips, mills said. those efforts include looking for __freed's__ vehicle, a 2010 nissan __altima.__ the police chief said that authorities had no solid leads. just a few days ago, the priest sent a note to his parishioners thanking them for their support and prayers and wishing them a merry christmas and happy new year. "i cannot tell you how proud and honored i am to be your __pastor,"__ freed wrote in a letter posted on the parish website. "our parish is alive, joyful and full of faith, hope and charity that define us as catholic __christians."__ while he was relatively new to st. __bernard,__ freed had already made an impact there and elsewhere around __eureka__ -- including with the city's __japanese-american__ community, as freed lived in japan for many years -- __jager__ told reporters. "this is an absolutely tremendous loss not only for the st. __bernard's__ parish, but for our community __generally,"__ the mayor said. "for those of us who believe in prayer, this is the time for that." his ties to __humbodt__ state went back even longer. a guest __lecturer,__ freed wrote a book about the first atomic bomb and also taught about the new __testament,__ connecting with christians and __non-christians__ alike. "he was very well respected, very well liked and had a tremendous working knowledge as well as academic knowledge," __cunha__ said. "... to think that he passed in this way: it's just layers of grief and shock."

although it's been in the works -- and riled __alarmists__ __(whoopi__ goldberg had some choice words to share back in __may)__ -- for a while, new york city's __"latch__ on __nyc"__ initiative, which will be put into practice in 27 of the city's 40 hospitals beginning on september 2, has caught a recent wave of inflammatory __flack__ among various __'news'__ sources, mom bloggers, and more. __nyc's__ mayor bloomberg announced the initiative shortly after the __aap__ released its new breastfeeding recommendations, which cite an ever-growing body of data supporting __breastfeeding's__ benefits to babies, moms, and the economy, and stressed __hospitals'__ important role in this picture. his initiative also followed the public appeal of dozens of consumer and health organizations, to hospitals, to stop doling out corporate formula __swag__ bags to every new mom they __discharge.__ __breastfeeding's__ health benefits are __indisputable,__ as are its dismal rates among american __moms.__ parenting.com: 15 toddler __superfoods__ . on the __up-side,__ however, studies have shown repeatedly that exposure to information about breastfeeding increases __moms'__ desire to give it a __whirl.__ and early, hands-on support __(followed__ by a supportive workplace and public __sphere)__ helps make it really happen. since us health officials hope to almost double the nursing count by 2020, hospitals seem like the logical place to start. it surprises me that latch on nyc has received such vocal criticism. and frankly, much of the recent criticism is based more in the alleged __"breastfeeding__ __debates"__ and their crossfire than in, you know, reality. more on that in a minute. first, here's the latch on nyc plan: in addition to a __pro-breastfeeding__ public transport poster campaign (not the first in the country by any __means),__ voluntarily complying hospitals __will:__ . - enforce the new york state hospital regulation to not supplement breastfeeding infants with formula unless medically indicated and documented on the infant's medical __chart-__ limit access to infant formula by hospital __staff-__ discontinue the distribution of promotional or free infant __formula-__ prohibit the display and distribution of infant formula advertising or promotional materials in any hospital location . what this means __is:nurses__ must document the dispensing of formula to new moms, citing a medical reason for its necessity. i.e. nurses will need to actually talk with new moms, and provide them with information and support in trying to __breastfeed__ before they hand out formula. given the difficulty i had in getting any breastfeeding support after my nyc hospital delivery, i would have welcomed some policy backing my requests. but for new moms who just plain don't want to __breastfeed,__ this definitely represents a change of __tides...__ not by much, though. no one will be forced to __breastfeed__ if they truly don't want to, __obviously.__ parenting.com: best cities for families . this policy provides an official way to hold hospitals accountable, rather than to condemn women's choices. in fact, the initiative clearly states that __"mothers__ who decide to formula feed and cannot afford formula will be referred to __wic__ __(women,__ infants and __children),__ a food and nutrition program for low-income families." i.e. the government is still giving out free formula to those who want to feed it to their babies but can't afford to buy it. this is hardly an __anti-formula-feeding__ campaign. (but it definitely is a __pro-breastfeeding__ __one).__ next up, limiting formula access means only that there'll be an extra step between a mom delivering her baby and a nurse handing her formula. namely, the mom will need to ask for it. again, i read this as a way to hold hospitals accountable for attending to each patient personally. finally, __discontinuing__ corporate __swag__ __(promotional__ materials and actual __formula)__ is a big deal, and a huge step. __karol__ __markowicz's__ (of the new york __post)__ opinion that "a mother isn't going to choose to feed her baby formula because she got a free __lanyard__ or __tote__ __bag"__ notwithstanding, the fact is that corporations are, by definition, the opposite of charitable __organizations;__ they vie for access to new moms __in-hospital__ because, a) brand loyalty is not to be __underestimated,__ and b) mothers assume hospitals have their patients' (i.e. the moms and babies they care __for)__ best interests at heart. parenting.com: 36 tips for breastfeeding success . so if a given formula is provided -- along with __"informational__ __literature"__ -- actually in the hospital, that formula must be, by __affiliation,__ a __baby's-best-interest__ choice. (it's a __subconscious,__ logical __conclusion.)__ of course babies can, and do, thrive on formula, but there's no debate in the medical field as to breast __milk's__ nutritional __superiority.__ by providing education and support around __breastfeeding,__ and removing formula manufacturers from the picture, hospitals are actually operating with increased professional __integrity;__ they are actually providing the best possible care to patients. and in some cases, this will mean providing formula to __babies...__ is it really so horrible that this won't come with a bunch of pr from __nestle?__ __no.as__ far as the controversy and crossfire is concerned, the post's __karol__ __markowicz,__ despite her __anything-but-objective__ objections to the initiative, made one __apt,__ if __obnoxiously-presented,__ point in her __critique.__ lisa __paladino,__ of staten island university hospital, had been quoted in this other post article, explaining that under the new system, a nurse will need to sign out each bottle of formula issued. __markowicz__ writes, "perhaps __paladino__ has never been around a hungry infant, but she should anticipate a cacophony of screams while perpetually __understaffed__ hospitals find nurse's aides to sign out formula like it's __morphine."__ while her analogy is rather __unhinged,__ her point about __understaffing__ is __important;__ i was really kind of freaked out, __post-delivery,__ by how little the nurses seemed to care for -- or even check on -- ____ my well-being. when the __'nurse__ __button'__ proved __pointless,__ i ended up __hobbling__ down the hallway, __barefoot,__ in search of a glass of drinking water. i was, meanwhile, nervous about my own abilities with a __newborn,__ and the lack of nurse oversight made me afraid that if my baby needed something while with me in my room __(something__ even more urgent than breastfeeding support, which definitely wasn't __forthcoming),__ there wouldn't be a good way to get medical __help...__ in a hospital. yeah. i know my breastfeeding experience -- and entire __post-delivery__ experience -- would have been improved with better __post-natal__ care, along with one-on-one breastfeeding help. bloomberg's initiative, along with the recent research pointing to the crucial role that hospitals play in breastfeeding success, will hopefully motivate hospitals to equip themselves with adequate nursing staffs in order to really attend to helping new moms get their __bearings__ -- around __breastfeeding,__ and otherwise. if they don't, this plan could __backfire.__ but if they do, and it __succeeds,__ it could prove to be a positive model for hospitals to follow, __nation-wide.__ parenting.com: the most awkward pregnancy photos ever . for her part, __markowicz__ has little else to offer. she __dubs__ bloomberg's initiative an __"anti-formula__ __crusade"__ and writes that breastfeeding hardly needs a __policy-backed__ __boost,__ __stating,__ "a mere 50 years ago, 75 percent of american infants were using __formula;__ breastfeeding was the odd way to feed a child." true, but fifty years ago -- 1962 -- was not exactly a progressive time in american history, particularly for women and __babies:__ __thalidomide__ for morning __sickness?__ twilight sleep __births?__ __hello?__ __markowicz__ has cited the least natural point in mainstream american birth practices as a way to ostensibly __'naturalize'__ formula __feeding's__ prime place in our hospitals today. it's a flimsy argument, and a strange __respose__ to a __(voluntary)__ change in policy here in __2012.those__ who are kicking up __(badly-written,__ and poorly __supported)__ dust around latch on nyc are fueling negativity for its own sake, as well as __divisiveness__ for the sake of attention (and page views, which add up to advertising __sales).__ let's not get sucked in. at the end of the day, the __post-delivery__ hospital stay is, under normal circumstances, quite brief. a couple of days won't keep __formula-minded__ moms from feeding their babies formula. but it can make all the difference in getting moms who want to __breastfeed__ onto a successful track. and greater numbers of successfully breastfeeding babies will make for a healthier population of babies, and moms, overall. this is a fact. this is why bloomberg jumped in to this incredibly controversial territory -- breastfeeding issues and corporate interests in health care __(wow,__ __double-whammy)__ -- in the first place. getting swept up in demonizing him, or in any uproar around this new policy, __distracts__ from what the initiative really means for new moms (more __support)__ and for hospitals __(step__ it __up).it's__ going to be __okay!__ it's not 1962 anymore. what do you think of the latch on nyc __initiative?__ what do you think all the uproar is really about?

baghdad, iraq (cnn) -- the iraqi olympic committee said saturday it stands by its decision to __disband__ the country's soccer association -- a move that led to the association's suspension from international football. world governing body fifa said friday it had decided to suspend the iraqi football association __(ifa)__ because of the iraqi olympic committee's move to __disband__ it. fifa described that as governmental interference. the suspension means iraqi soccer clubs and teams may not play in international matches or receive financial assistance, though fifa made an exception for iraqi female players to play in a weeklong __under-16__ regional football festival in jordan starting sunday. fifa said it learned monday that the iraqi olympic committee had disbanded the __ifa__ and that governmental security forces had seized control of the __ifa__ headquarters. fifa officials gave the committee 72 hours to revoke the decision and hand the headquarters back to the __ifa.__ "the deadline has expired without revocation of the decision by the iraqi olympic committee and the __ifa__ has not been restored to its __headquarters,"__ fifa said in a statement friday. "the fifa emergency committee has therefore decided to immediately suspend the __ifa__ until the decision of the iraqi olympic committee is revoked and the __ifa__ __retakes__ possession of its __offices."__ the iraqi olympic committee's actions are in "total __contradiction"__ to fifa __statutes,__ which require national teams to have full independence, fifa said. two top iraqi officials said saturday the decision to __disband__ the __ifa__ was based on financial and administrative irregularities and violations, and that they were not surprised by fifa's decision and had expected it. samir __al-moussawi,__ a senior member of the iraqi olympic committee, told cnn he was hopeful the issue could be resolved with fifa in the coming days, and that the olympic committee had international lawyers working on the issue. he denied, however, that government security forces had seized __ifa__ headquarters, saying the men were protection services personnel guarding the building. ali __al-dabbagh,__ the iraqi government spokesman who has been __delegated__ for months to deal with the international olympic committee, told cnn he will work on cooperating with fifa's demands and holding transparent __ifa__ elections. he said the suspension "will not have a major effect" on iraqi football because the national team has no international matches scheduled over the next six months. it is the second time fifa has suspended iraqi football. the first time was in may last year, after the iraqi government dissolved the national olympic committee and all national sports __federations.__ fifa lifted the ban after the iraqi government excluded the __ifa__ from __dissolution.__ iraqi soccer has come a long way since the days of saddam hussein, when hussein's son, __uday,__ was president of the iraqi olympic committee and regularly threatened players with physical violence and torture if they played __poorly.__ the national soccer team has continued playing, however, and has been viewed as something that has united iraqis across sectarian lines. although iraq has not qualified for next year's world cup in south africa, the national team was able to celebrate becoming the asia champions in 2007. in july, iraq played its first home game since 2002, beating its palestinian opponents __4-0.__ tens of thousands attended the match in the capital after fifa lifted its ban on international games in iraq. cnn's jomana karadsheh contributed to this report.

(cnn) -- a month ago, __elana__ meyers was hurtling down the sochi __bobsleigh__ track at 150 kph on her way to winning an olympic silver medal. now the 29-year-old has swapped the ice for a rugby ball as she sets out on her quest to be a summer olympian with the united states sevens team at the rio games in 2016. it's an ambitious bid -- meyers had never played the game until two weeks ago. "i'm offside all the time," she says __frankly.__ "i'm running ahead of the ball all the time. "the other problem is that with the __bobsleigh,__ i was used to just running in a straight line. that seems to be my default setting, and it doesn't work like that in rugby __sevens.__ it's a sharp learning __curve."__ meyers could have been forgiven for taking more time off after the olympics. with a bronze from vancouver four years ago, she had gone to sochi seeking gold with new partner __lauryn__ williams -- a track star who tasted success at london 2012 in the 4 x 100 meters relay and won 400m silver in 2004. in the end, they came __agonizingly__ close to victory, edged out by just one-tenth of a second after four runs on the olympic course by canadian duo __kaillie__ humphries and heather __moyse.__ it left meyers with her __demons.__ in the following days, she wrote on her blog: "every night, i'm haunted by that last run. i haven't slept much since it happened. i replay the __skids__ so vividly in my head that any thoughts of the other corners are reduced to a mere hazy memory. "so how does it feel to feel like you choked in front of the whole world? how does it feel to have your lifelong dream slip away literally from your __fingertips?__ it __sucks.__ was i too __exhausted?__ did i just finally hit my mental __limits?__ i don't know." the inquest into every painstaking moment of that final run -- the american duo's slowest by half a second -- has __dissipated__ in recent weeks, but meyers concedes "you still can't help going through what happened, what you might have done differently." she has allowed herself to increasingly dwell on the silver lining of sochi more often than asking "what __if?"__ thankfully, there has been barely been a chance to stop and think -- there were __welcome-home__ celebrations in georgia before she set out on her sevens mission, and meyers also has a wedding to plan. prior to traveling to russia, u.s. eagles coach ric __suggitt__ invited meyers to the us olympic training center __(otc)__ in california to test herself at __rugby.__ "a couple of girls on the __bobsleigh__ team had previously played rugby and made the __switch,"__ she says. "so i thought why can't i do it the other way around? "the coach asked me if i was interested in coming to practice and then come out after the olympics for a trial. i'd never tried it out before so i thought, 'why __not?'__ "even though i haven't played the game before, i think they looked at me and thought i was the right build. i'm a big girl -- i'm 175 __lbs__ and 5 foot 8 inches -- so i knew i wasn't worried about doing the hitting or getting hit. "i think i was just worried about not knowing the rules. it's been a case of out of the frying pan and into the fire, but it's been a __blast."__ the switch of sports is nothing new for her. her first sporting foray of note had been in softball and there were hopes of being selected for the u.s. team for the 2008 olympics. she missed out, and the sport was duly scrapped from the olympic schedule. by then, her focus had already switched to the __bobsleigh,__ an event she first tried out in 2007. it has brought her two olympic medals and two world titles, as well as a fiance -- fellow american __bobsledder__ nic taylor. the pair had been dating for two years when taylor took the decision to pop the question at the 2013 world championships in st. __moritz,__ with meyers standing on the podium. taylor had roses in his hand when he was handed the microphone by organizers, and he dropped to one knee. at the time, meyers __admitted:__ "it was such a shock. it was amazing." as if mastering a new sport wasn't enough, meyers is now planning a wedding for april 24. "it's been crazy but it's mostly planned. obviously the focus was on sochi so we were a little bit late out with the invitations but we're steadily getting the __rsvps__ in," she says. "i'm getting married at my parents' house. it's already been a great 2014 whatever happens with the rugby, and i'm pretty excited about the big day." the pressure is on meyers to play a remarkable game of __catchup__ with her fellow american rugby players as she attempts to marry her strengths to the requirements of the code -- a shortened version of the __15-a-side__ union format. but as an athlete nicknamed __"e-money"__ -- from her ability to deliver when it counts in the pressure situations -- she is confident she will get to grips with it. "if it goes well, it would be awesome to be part of the team in __rio,"__ she says. __"rio__ was the thing that got me interested and that's the very obvious goal. "but that's some way off. my legs were burning so much from that first week. it's not that i'm not fit but this is such a different level of fitness, there's so much __cardio.__ "but i'm optimistic that i'll get better ... a lot better. to get to rio would just be super crazy." in her sporting switch, she has had a useful ally in williams. __"lauryn__ talked about how special the summer games was, how huge it was," says __meyers.__ "she talked a lot about the pressure of being on the start line for the 100m final. "i've basically been asking her for as much information as possible. she's given me some good __advice."__ meyers has __oval-ball__ history -- her father used to play in the nfl for the atlanta __falcons,__ though his career was coming to an end when she was young. "if i'm honest, the thing i remember the most was the team mascot, freddie the __falcon,"__ she says laughing. "i really remember there was a mcdonald's nearby and i remember eating a __cheeseburger__ in the playground when the falcon appeared. i'm not sure my dad appreciates that being my favorite memory of him __playing."__ despite her new sporting __flirtation,__ meyers is not divorcing herself from the ice track just yet. "as we get closer to rio, i realize i may need to change my approach and focus more __solely,__ on __sevens,__ but i don't want to give up the __bobsleigh__ at the moment. i love it too much."

tripoli, libya (cnn) -- embattled libyan leader moammar gadhafi, in negotiations with the african union, has agreed in principal to a deal that would end the conflict in the nation he's ruled for 42 years, south african president jacob zuma told reporters sunday. negotiations remained under way sunday night between gadhafi and the african union delegation. details of the agreement were not available, though it is believed to include an immediate ceasefire in the nearly two-month long war between gadhafi's forces and those fighting to unseat him. in his comments, zuma also discussed an end to nato airstrikes aimed at enforcing a no-fly zone and targeting gadhafi's troops. after staying overnight in tripoli, the african union delegation will fly monday to the libyan rebel stronghold of benghazi to meet with opposition leaders there. gadhafi has been a strong supporter of the african union and has channeled large sums of money its way. libya also holds a seat on the 15-member peace and security council. as such, opposition leaders have voiced skepticism that mediation would end the conflict in a way that would satisfy their goals, which include gadhafi's ouster. tony blair's take on libya . the african union's special committee on libya is represented by mauritania, the democratic republic of congo, mali, uganda as well as zuma's south africa. as gadhafi left one meeting at his compound in tripoli, he made a rare public appearance for international media before riding off in a car as he waved to supporters near his tent. the leader then entered a second meeting with the delegation. earlier sunday, __mauritanian__ president mohamed __ould__ abdel aziz told journalists that the meetings "will discuss the ways to resolve the crisis in libya, and our main goal is to stop the military operations and find adequate solutions for the problem between our libyan brothers," according to a __mauritanian__ news agency. report tracks __"sweeping__ __changes"__ in mideast . after a series of setbacks driven by the advances of pro-government forces, libyan rebel fighters this weekend recaptured the besieged city of __ajdabiya__ after apparently holding off gadhafi's __better-equipped__ forces. in a hospital, witnesses told cnn on saturday that three of gadhafi's fighters who were killed were carrying identification cards from syria, algeria and chad. meanwhile, in misrata, nato airstrikes hit parts of the city overnight and sunday, an eyewitness told cnn, who did not want to be named for security reasons. at least eight people were killed and 22 injured from saturday's fighting between the pro-gadhafi forces and the rebels, according to medical sources in the city. on sunday, two rebel fighters died as they attempted to hunt down pro-gadhafi snipers near the city center, another eyewitness said. the rebels were able to recover the bodies of 15 such snipers shot earlier sunday. the snipers took positions on top of residential and commercial buildings, the eyewitness said. nato airstrikes on sunday hit various positions in and around the city, destroying 14 tanks, the eyewitness said. sporadic fighting continued sunday, but had decreased from recent days as the airstrikes kept pro-gadhafi forces busy. graffiti artist killed in libya . some youths, captured in recent days by rebels, said they were teenagers and __secondary-school__ students who had been forced to leave their homes in nearby towns and villages and undergo mandatory weeklong military training before fighting in misrata, according to the second __eyewitness.__ pro-gadhafi forces continued shelling parts of the city sunday morning, the eyewitness said. a steel mill near the port was targeted but the port is now under rebel control, eyewitnesses said. however, the port still holds about 4,000 foreign workers who are trying to leave the city. civilians living in the western sections of misrata have been forced to leave their homes and have gathered in schools and friends' and relatives' homes near the city center, eyewitnesses said. in a statement saturday, nato said its aircraft destroyed pro-gadhafi ammunition stockpiles east of tripoli that were supplying troops shelling misrata and other cities. the alliance also made attacks on armored vehicles near misrata and __ajdabiya,__ nato said. opposition spokesman __shamsiddin__ __abdulmolah__ told cnn that rebels flew two attack helicopters from __tobruk__ to join the fighting in __ajdabiya.__ "there were some 50 regime pickup trucks with machine guns and rocket launchers that attempted to enter __ajdabiya,"__ __abdulmolah__ said. "the helicopters destroyed several of the trucks, and the rest took off." __abdulmolah__ did not know what kind of helicopters the rebel forces used in saturday's attack and could not confirm whether rebel forces coordinated the operation with nato. nato is operating under a u.n. security council resolution authorizing the use of force to protect libyan civilians from attack. the united nations said secretary-general ban ki-moon will travel to cairo thursday to head meetings on libya at the arab league headquarters. among the participants will be catherine ashton, the representative for foreign affairs and security for the european union. while gadhafi has largely stayed out of the public eye in recent days, state tv aired images saturday of the leader visiting what appeared to be a primary school in tripoli. the anchor said the school was a target of international airstrikes and was going to be attacked. but nato said in its statement that gadhafi's forces continue to use civilians as human __shields.__ "we have observed horrific examples of regime forces deliberately placing their weapons systems close to civilians, their homes and even their places of __worship,"__ said lt. gen. charlie __bouchard,__ commander of nato's operation unified __protector.__ __"troops__ have also been observed hiding behind women and children. this type of behavior violates the principles of international law and will not be tolerated." cnn's frederik pleitgen, reza sayah, nic robertson and yousuf basil contributed to this report .

(cnn) -- organizers for the controversial bahrain grand prix have been given a boost after several formula one teams, including world champions red bull, told cnn they will not unilaterally pull out of the race. following reports this week that some teams were planning on canceling their appearance at the grand prix, which is due to take place april 22 at the bahrain international circuit on the persian gulf island, cnn contacted all 12 __constructors.__ nine declined to comment but red bull, whose driver sebastian vettel won the drivers' championship and who also clinched the 2011 constructors' title, told cnn that the decision on whether the bahrain grand prix goes ahead is a matter for motorsport's governing body the federation __internationale__ de __l'automobile__ __[fia]__ and not individual teams. teams won't pull out . "it's up to the __fia,"__ a red bull spokesperson said. "we take part in the f1 championship and if that calendar includes a race in bahrain then we will be racing in bahrain. it's not up to the teams to pick and choose which races we take part in. "the fia are the ones monitoring the situation. they are the ones who make a decision based on what is happening on the ground and we take their __guidance."__ bernie __ecclestone,__ the driving force behind formula one, had earlier stated that it is up to the individual teams to decide whether they would race in bahrain. "we've no way we can force people to go there," he told the uk press association. "we can't say __'you've__ got to __go'__ -- although they would be in breach of their agreement with us if they didn't go -- but it doesn't help. commercially they have to go, but whether they decide to or not is up to them. i've had no one say anything other than 'we're going to be racing in __bahrain'."__ by not racing in bahrain, any formula one team would be breaking the concorde agreement -- a commercial contract between fia, __ecclestone's__ formula one administration and the teams -- and would be liable to potentially __ruinous__ __multi-million-dollar__ __censure.__ __"teams__ are unable to cancel grands __prix,"__ replied the formula one team association __(fota).__ "we race in an international series called the fia formula one world championship, and it is therefore for the fia to offer the teams guidance on these issues." a year of protests . controversy has raged over the bahrain grand prix ever since an uprising against the ruling al khalifa royal family rocked the kingdom just over a year ago. pro-democracy protests were __crushed,__ with dozens killed in the ensuing violence. last year's race was canceled as a result but protests have continued in the run up to this year's race. local human rights groups claim that abuses have continued despite government assurances to the contrary. "if formula one go ahead with the race it will give the impression that everything is back to normal when everything is not back to normal. people are dying on a daily basis," __nabeel__ __rajab,__ head of the bahrain center for human rights, told cnn. "i say think of the human rights, think of things other than just your profit and your interest. human rights have to come first," he added. "we will welcome you back when everything is back to normal, when the killing and arrests have stopped in the streets." however, zayed al __zayani,__ chairman of the bahrain international circuit __(bic)__ where the f1 race will be __staged,__ insisted that safety would not be a problem and blamed the crisis on press __"scaremongering."__ "what has been happening is that armchair observers -- who have not been sufficiently interested or committed to investigate the situation for themselves -- have been driving this debate, at the expense of those neutral parties who have taken the trouble to investigate the situation at first hand," __zayani__ said in a statement released to cnn. __"this,__ combined with the __scaremongering__ tactics of certain small extremist groups on social networking sites, has created huge misconceptions about the current situation." negative publicity . such has been the negative publicity surrounding the race, __bic__ released a statement on monday quoting british parliamentary mp ben wallace, the british ambassador to bahrain iain lindsay and the lotus f1 team as saying that bahrain was safe and the race should go ahead. but that move backfired when the lotus f1 team criticized __bic__ for using their quotes without permission. "these quotes were part of a full internal and confidential working document, that was also sent on a confidential basis to all f1 team managers last week," lotus f1 said in their statement. __"lotus__ f1 team is one of 12 contestants of the formula one world championship and we would never try to substitute ourselves for the __fÃÂ©dÃÂ©ration__ __internationale__ de __l'automobile__ __(fia),__ which is the only party entitled to determine if a grand prix should go ahead or not." the situation has been further exacerbated by the condition of human rights activist __abdulhadi__ al __khawaja,__ who has been on hunger strike for close to two months after being jailed for life charged with plotting to overthrow the state. international rights organizations, including amnesty international, have called for his release. according to the british newspaper the independent, ecclestone reportedly phoned a leading writer and activist in bahrain to check on al __khawaja's__ condition and even offered to host a press conference with opposition figures. __"(mr__ __ecclestone)__ said he was very concerned about what is going on," dr. __ala'a__ __shehabi__ told the independent. "he said the crown prince __(salman__ bin hamad al __khalifa)__ told him that al __khawaja__ was doing fine, but i said that i am hearing very different reports." decision __sunday?__ this weekend will see the shanghai grand prix take center stage. "as it stands we're due to fly there __(bahrain)__ straight from shanghai so a decision on whether the race takes place could be taken as late as sunday morning," a spokesman for the toro rosso team told cnn. "clearly it's a situation that we would like to see resolved as soon as possible. i certainly don't think it will be a case of some teams going and some not going. it will be everybody or __nobody.__ "the team bosses will have a meeting in china ... bernie ecclestone will of course be there and i'm sure they will thrash something out." although several former drivers, like the british 1996 world champion damon hill, have voiced concerns over the bahrain grand prix, the current crop has been largely silent on whether the race should be won. "if we go, it's a good decision to make," two-time world champion vettel told cnn wednesday. "if we don't go, we don't go."

los angeles (cnn) -- orange is the new brown __wardrobe.__ chris brown's lawyer was unable to persuade a los angeles judge to let the singer out of jail on monday. brown, 24, wore an orange jail jumpsuit at court, with his mother sitting behind him, while attorney mark geragos argued the singer should be allowed to enter another rehab program instead of spending the next month in jail. the singer was locked up on a probation violation warrant friday after he was booted from a court-ordered drug rehab program. assistant district attorney mary murray said brown has already been ejected from two rehab programs in the last five months and another program should not be considered. los angeles county superior court judge james __brandlin__ said he was concerned about a __"provocative"__ statement counselors said brown wrote on a card at the malibu rehab center. "i am good at using guns and __knives,"__ according to a document read in court. the rehab program told brown to leave because of that statement and two other rules violations, the document said. brown refused a drug test -- which his lawyer denied -- and he touched elbows with a female patient, according to the document. brown's next chance to get out of jail comes on april 23 when __brandlin__ considers if his arrest on a misdemeanor assault charge in washington justifies keeping him locked up. there is a possibility the judge will speed up that decision so brown can travel to d.c. for a trial on that charge. brown's legal troubles began five years ago, when he beat rihanna as the two sat in a rented lamborghini on a hollywood street. he pleaded guilty to felony assault in june 2009, which resulted in a sentence of five years of probation and 1,400 hours of community labor. the judge has revoked brown's probation twice in the past year, most recently because of his arrest on a sidewalk near the white house after he allegedly punched a man. brown voluntarily entered a rehab program a day after being released from a washington jail in october, but he was kicked out a few days later for __"throwing__ a rock through his mother's car __window"__ after a family session at the center, a probation report said. brown was upset because his mother said she wanted him to stay in treatment, the report said. "mr. brown proceeded to walk outside and pick up a rock and threw it through his mother's car window and it __shattered,"__ according to a letter from the rehab center included in the probation report. his probation was revoked in november, but the judge allowed him to stay out of jail by entering a 90-day anger management and drug rehab program. although he completed that program last month, the judge had ordered him to remain a resident at the malibu treatment facility until a hearing on april 23. brown's probation officer reported at a hearing last month that the singer "continues to make great __improvement"__ in dealing with anger, stress and drugs, but the judge decided he could not go free until after his trial for the assault charge in washington on april 17. if he is convicted in that case, the judge would decide april 23 whether brown should complete his probation in jail. brown has been working on a highway cleanup labor crew in los angeles three days a week to fulfill the 750 hours of service remaining in his probation requirements, his probation report said. at that rate, brown could complete the labor in __mid-october__ and possibly be free from probation requirements by the end of the year. however, the clock is stopped while brown is locked up. cnn's __topher__ __gauk-roger__ and carolyn sung contributed to this report.

(ew.com) -- animated movies have topped the box office for the past four weekends, but this time around, audiences were ready to embrace something a bit __edgier.__ as such, warner __bros.'__ horror film "the __conjuring"__ easily topped a crowded weekend with an eye-popping __$41.5__ million. the $20 million james __wan-directed__ title garnered the best horror debut of the year, __trumping__ the __purge's__ __$34.1__ million bow in may. it also had the __second-best__ debut ever for an r-rated horror film, trailing only paranormal activity 3, which opened with __$52.6__ million in 2011. the film notched a powerful __$14,306__ per theater average, and if it receives strong word-of-mouth (which seems __likely),__ it could become a $100 million __smash.__ audiences, which were 53 percent female and 59 percent above the age of 25, issued the __conjuring__ an excellent __"a-"__ cinemascore grade â an especially impressive rating given the fact that the horror genre that has seen its fair share of __"d"__ and __"f"__ grades. the __conjuring's__ debut marks a career high for __wan,__ who broke onto the scene in 2004 with his __$55.2__ million hit saw, a film so __buzzy__ it steered horror films into the torture direction for years after its release. in 2011, wan scored a __spookier__ hit with __insidious,__ which, like the __conjuring,__ starred patrick wilson. insidious earned __$54__ million against a $1.5 million budget and now has a sequel hitting theaters on september 13. the __conjuring__ will easily __outgross__ both of those films, though it's all but guaranteed that __wan's__ next effort, fast & furious 7, will be his biggest hit yet. despicable me 2 held strong in second place, dipping 43 percent to __$25.1__ million in its third weekend. the __$76__ million sequel from universal and __illumination__ entertainment needed only 17 days to surpass the original despicable __me's__ __$251.5__ million domestic total. today, the film has earned __$276.2__ million. overseas, despicable me 2 has already surpassed the $300 million mark, pushing its worldwide total to __$584.6__ million. in third place, turbo started its box office run at a __snail's__ pace. the __$135__ million animated comedy, featuring the voice of ryan reynolds as a radioactive __snail,__ grossed __$21.5__ million in its first weekend â the worst debut for a dreamworks animation film since __2006â²s__ flushed away opened with __$18.8__ million. hot on the heels of monsters university and despicable me 2, it's likely that turbo suffered because audiences have had their fill of family fare over the past few weeks. fortunately, the crowds that did see turbo liked what they saw and gave it an "a" cinemascore grade, which could help word-of-mouth in the future, though there's almost no chance the film matches its budget domestically. __turbo's__ lackluster debut casts some shadow on fox and dreamworks __animation's__ infant relationship. earlier this year, fox distributed the __croods,__ its first dreamworks __animation-produced__ film in a five-year deal between the studios. the __caveman__ comedy grossed __$186__ million domestically and __$582__ million worldwide. the fact that turbo will come nowhere close to those numbers makes its opening all the more disappointing. grown ups 2 fell 52 percent from its first weekend to $20 million in its second frame. sony's $80 million adam sandler comedy continues to perform well despite its critical __savaging,__ and it has now earned __$79.5__ million after ten days. grown ups 2 is on track to pass the $100 million mark with ease, and it will become __sandler's__ 13th live-action comedy to reach that milestone. whether you love sandler or hate him, you can't deny his remarkable box office record. in fifth place, red 2 took in __$18.5__ million, 15 percent less than the original __red's__ __$21.8__ million opening in 2010. the summit sequel starring bruce willis, helen __mirren,__ mary louise parker, and john __malkovich,__ got a big __budget-boost__ from its predecessor, but like the __expendables__ 2, that didn't grow the film's audience at the box office. while red cost only __$58__ million and ultimately earned $199 million worldwide, red 2 cost $85 million, and its weaker american debut suggests it won't climb nearly as high at the box office. audiences gave red 2 a __"b+"__ cinemascore grade. 1. the __conjuring__ -- __$41.5__ million . 2. despicable me 2 -- $25 million . 3. turbo -- __$21.5__ million . 4. grown ups 2 -- $20 million . 5. red 2 -- $18 million . further down the chart, __r.i.p.d.,__ in which ryan reynolds and jeff bridges play cops in the __afterlife,__ bombed with __$12.8__ million in its first three days. the film also stars mary louise parker, which means that both she and reynolds faced themselves at the box office this weekend â and both fared __poorly.__ in press notes sent to journalists this morning, universal admits "in this crowded marketplace, __r.i.p.d.__ did not find the size audience it needed and universal is disappointed in the weekend result." the studio says the action comedy cost $130 million (though its budget has been reported at __$154__ million), which makes __r.i.p.d.__ an expensive __misfire__ for the studio that hasn't suffered a major __misstep__ since __battleship.__ this year at the box office has been riddled with costly mistakes, and __r.i.p.d.__ joins the ranks of after earth, white house down, the lone ranger, and jack the giant __slayer__ -- big-budget __tentpoles__ that audiences firmly rejected. crowds issued __r.i.p.d.__ a negative __"c+"__ __cinemascore.__ so for those of you keeping __score:__ __turbo,__ red 2, and __r.i.p.d.__ collectively cost $350 million and earned __$52.8__ million this weekend at the box office. the __conjuring,__ meanwhile, cost $20 million and earned __$41.5__ million. see the original story at ew.com. click here to try 2 risk free

(cnn) -- alex __okosi__ left nigeria as a young boy in the late 1980s to seek a better future in the united states. by the early 2000s, the music executive was carving a successful career with broadcasting giant __mtv,__ holding strategic positions within the influential __medial__ company both in the united states and europe. yet, __okosi__ never forgot where he came from. his dream had always been to promote his continent's diverse music scene and vibrant youth culture. in the __mid-2000s,__ at a time when not many were convinced about his continent's economic potential, __okosi__ helped persuade his bosses to launch a dedicated mtv channel for africa. today, as the senior vice president and managing director of mtv networks africa, __okosi__ runs mtv base, the company's first localized television service targeted exclusively at sub-saharan africa. "we've ... been quite lucky in being able to create a brand that we have taken from our international stable and bring into the continent to be able to create content and experiences that people __enjoy,__ __localizing__ them to make sure that they cater to the attitudes and tastes of african __audiences,"__ says __okosi,__ now based in south africa. read related: malian __kora__ legend breaks music barriers . born in the west african country of nigeria, __okosi__ moved to the united states at the age of 12. he excelled throughout school, graduated with high honors in 1994 and won a scholarship to st. michael's college in vermont. he credits his mentor __midge__ monte for shaping his character and showing him the value of working hard to achieve your goals. __"midge__ was such an important an influential part of my life as she served as my guardian the last two years of my high school career and has since remained a huge part of my life," says __okosi.__ __"midge__ also instilled in me the importance of hard work and commitment as one strives to be successful." __okosi's__ determination and academic excellence helped him land a job with mtv straight after university. his talents soon started to shine -- __okosi__ worked both in mtv's new york and west coast offices before moving to london to be part of the company's international strategy team. he first planted the seed of bringing mtv to africa during a business lunch with the head of the broadcasting giant. __okosi__ was convinced about the power and value of the african market, but putting together a viable business plan was far from easy -- a lack of data on the size of the advertising market, coupled with infrastructure challenges, hampered __okosi's__ ambitions. yet, despite all the challenges, __okosi__ was determined to succeed.

(cnn) -- president obama on tuesday outlined an ambitious agenda that requires "significant resources," even as he aims to __halve__ the deficit by the end of his first term. president obama says the united states will overcome . its current economic struggles. in his first speech to a joint session of congress, obama said it's time to act boldly not just to revive the economy, but "to build a new foundation for lasting __prosperity."__ "while the cost of action will be great, i can assure you that the cost of inaction will be far __greater,"__ he said. the president struck an optimistic tone, asserting that "we will rebuild, we will recover, and the united states of america will emerge stronger than before." obama focused on the three priorities of the budget he will present to congress later this week: energy, health care and education. the president said he sees his budget as a __"vision__ for america -- as a blueprint for our future," but not something that will solve every problem or address every issue. ____ watch obama lay out his plan to "save our children from __debt"__ Â» . "it reflects the stark reality of what we've inherited -- a trillion dollar deficit, a financial crisis, and a costly __recession,"__ he said. obama said his administration already has identified $2 trillion in government spending cuts that can be made over the next decade. ____ see video highlights of the speech, issue by issue Â» . the president touted the $787 billion stimulus plan he signed into law last week, saying it will invest in areas critical to the country's economic recovery. he also made bold promises for what these investments will achieve. obama predicted that because of the recovery plan, the united states will double its supply of renewable energy in the next three years. he also said the country will invest $15 billion a year to develop technology for green energy. ____ grade obama's speech Â» . obama also pledged a "historic __commitment"__ to health care and said the recovery plan could lead to a cure for cancer. he also promised the __"largest__ investment ever" in preventive care. on education, obama set a goal of having the highest college graduation rate in the world by 2020. he pointed to the billions for education -- from early childhood education expansion to __college-loan__ programs -- in the economic stimulus package to ensure that every child has access to education "from the day they are born to the day they begin a career." obama also said his budget will pay for more soldiers and marines, increase their pay and expand veterans health care and benefits. ireport.com: did obama really __deliver?__ obama said the recovery plans already in the works are immediate steps to revive the economy in the __short-term,__ "but the only way to fully restore america's economic strength is to make the long-term investments that will lead to new jobs, new industries, and a renewed ability to compete with the rest of the world." __"slowly,__ but surely, confidence will return, and our economy will __recover,"__ he said, asking congress to join him in "doing whatever proves necessary because we cannot __consign__ our nation to an open-ended __recession."__ obama promised to reform the regulatory system to "ensure that a crisis of this magnitude never happens again." the president also signaled that he was willing to take on __entitlements,__ saying that congress must take on the growing costs of medicare and social security. obama described the nation's financial woes as a __"reckoning"__ for poor decisions made by both government and individuals. ____ watch what obama says about the "day of __reckoning"__ Â» . "a surplus became an excuse to transfer wealth to the wealthy instead of an opportunity to invest in our future," obama said. __"regulations__ were gutted for the sake of a quick profit at the expense of a healthy market. people bought homes they knew they couldn't afford from banks and lenders who pushed those bad loans anyway. and all the while, critical debates and difficult decisions were put off for some other time on some other day." noting that is easy to "become cynical and __doubtful,"__ obama said he has learned that "hope is found in unlikely places." obama avoided lofty rhetoric and instead used examples of specific people to __personalize__ his points. __abess__ is a bank president from miami, florida, who reportedly cashed out of his company, took a $60 million bonus and distributed it among people who had worked for him. __bethea__ is an __eighth-grade__ girl from south carolina who, in a letter to lawmakers, asked for help for her school and said, "we are not __quitters."__ ____ watch obama talk about __bethea__ saying "we are not __quitters"__ Â» . while the economy was the focus of the speech, obama also touched on foreign policy. the president said he'll soon be laying out specifics on how to win the war in afghanistan and end the one in iraq. "we are now carefully reviewing our policies in both wars, and i will soon announce a way forward in iraq that leaves iraq to its people and responsibly ends this war," he said. ____ watch the entire speech Â» . meanwhile, he said, both afghanistan and its border with pakistan will remain a key focus. because obama's presidency is just a month old, the speech is not technically considered a state of the union address. the annual state of the union speech is delivered in the house of representatives before members of both the house and the senate as well as the justices of the supreme court, the president's cabinet and international __dignitaries.__ cnn's kristi keck contributed to this report.

"i walked and believed that if i prayed over that ground, if i walked over that ground, something good would come of it." in 2006, he learned that all 15 acres of the church's property are on one of the largest natural gas fields in the country, known as the barnett __shale.__ "what a god we serve," spears said, followed by great laughter. ____ watch an oil drilling __bonanza__ Â» . spears' church and thousands of residents around the fort worth area are cashing in on a unique urban drilling __bonanza.__ with the development of horizontal drilling technology and with gas prices __sky-high,__ energy companies are racing to tap into the barnett shale natural gas field. the barnett shale is the __most-productive__ natural gas field in such a highly populated area spanning 5,000 square miles. the drilling here is being watched closely in louisiana and pennsylvania, which also have natural gas fields under urban areas. ____ see where the barnett shale is located Â» . energy companies in the fort worth area are going __door-to-door,__ negotiating with people for access to mineral rights under their homes. that means residents are offered a bonus check and future monthly royalty checks. spears' church received a __$32,000__ bonus and receives between $3,000 and $10,000 a month in royalty checks. the money is helping pay for a multimillion-dollar expansion and a new sanctuary. "we're making a lot of millionaires up here in the barnett shale area," said julie wilson, vice president of chesapeake energy, one of the energy companies drilling wells in the fort worth area. the fort worth chamber of commerce says the urban drilling craze has created more than 50,000 jobs and will pump nearly $1 billion in tax revenue into the city's economy. but opponents of this urban drilling say that it shouldn't be done in populated areas and that the promises of many people getting rich aren't true. they say that for most people, the __payouts__ are __modest.__ how much money residents get depends on how much property they own and how much gas -- if any -- is found. the dollar figure also depends on each __resident's__ negotiating skills with energy companies, experts say. the money can range from a few hundred dollars to tens of thousands. "it's a divide and conquer strategy by going around and giving everybody enough money to keep them quiet. __hush__ money is what i call it," said don young, a community activist who operates a blog called __fwcando.org.__ __"gas__ drilling is very __dirty;__ it's very dangerous." to 72-year-old jerry __horton,__ the drilling is a threat to her cherished front yard. to move the natural gas through the city, chesapeake energy needs to bury a pipeline in her yard. she's been offered almost __$13,000,__ up from the $3,000 she was initially offered. "i wouldn't sell my front yard for a million dollars," said __horton,__ a retired artist who has lived in the same house for 53 years. chesapeake energy recently sued horton for access to her front yard, claiming eminent domain. the company says pipelines are crucial to keep the natural gas flowing and allow people to cash in the profits under the ground.

"but we don't need to destroy our homes, all of our trees and blow ourselves up. who's going to be here to enjoy the gas __then?"__ energy companies say that drilling for natural gas is safe and done in an environmentally friendly way. but opponents say the drilling is dangerous and a threat to the environment. __"gas__ drilling ... has no business in an urban area. so i don't want to contribute to a company that's doing that to my community," said young, who refused to let his property be used. while energy companies maintain the drilling is not a threat to homes, some question the impact of drilling beneath neighborhoods. young and other activists also are concerned about air and water pollution, soil contamination, health and safety issues and the loss of green space and wildlife. "we're guinea __pigs,"__ young said. "we're the first large metropolitan area ever to have intense natural gas drilling going on in our neighborhood, right in the heart of the city."

(ew.com) -- have you picked your jaws up off the floor yet, __gladiators?__ if so, well done. indeed, it was probably a fairly __herculean__ task considering all the mind-blowing revelations in __"scandal's"__ __twisty__ season 3 premiere. though several one-on-one scenes took __liv__ away from her trusted __gladiators__ for much of the opener, you can be sure this __thick-as-thieves__ crew will be facing the onslaught together in weeks to come. ew talked with three of __liv's__ __fixers__ â katie __lowes,__ guillermo __dÃ­az__ and __darby__ __stanchfield__ â about their reactions to the premiere (yes, even they were surprised by some __things!)__ and what's to come for pope & associates this year. __(spoiler__ __alert!__ if you haven't seen the premiere, don't keep __reading.)__ __'ncis,'__ 'the __mentalist,'__ __'hawaii__ __five-0,'__ __'castle':__ find out what's next in the spoiler room . "it's __handled"__ picked up right where the season 2 finale left off â with olivia pope __(kerry__ __washington)__ under the microscope thanks to her affair with president fitzgerald __"fitz"__ grant __(tony__ __goldwyn)__ going public. trying to cut off that problem at the pass was cia black ops commander rowan __(joe__ __morton),__ a.k.a. __liv's__ dad, who had arranged a convenient international getaway. surprising absolutely no one, __liv__ decided to forgo the easy way out and returned to her __gladiators__ to fix ... herself. once __liv__ returned, reformed assassin and personal __confidante__ __huck__ was a natural choice to escort his mentor back into her inner __sanctum.__ "it's a really short but really powerful scene when he's pulling her out of the __limo,"__ __dÃ­az__ says. "he's like her __watchdog.__ he's that guy that's always thinking about her safety and protecting her and __[making__ __sure]__ nothing __bad's__ going to happen to her __[because]__ she's the one that saved him." but can the __gladiators__ save __liv__ now that she's in the sights of cold-blooded __frenemy__ â and __fitz's__ chief of staff â cyrus __(jeff__ __perry)?__ even __stanchfield,__ who plays no-nonsense pope employee __abby,__ was shocked when she finally saw one scene in particular play out on film. "we were watching the first episode where cyrus starts the __'kill__ __folder'__ [on __olivia],"__ the actress remembers. "we'd all forgotten about it __[since__ the table __read],__ and we all just lost our __marbles.__ it was incredible." she adds, __"cyrus__ can be so evil â just when you think you were going to trust __him!__ i start to like the guy, and then he does something like that, and i'm just like, 'you're dead forever now __...,'"__ then she laughs, "at least for another __episode."__ cyrus isn't the only one who's out for blood. __liv's__ newest __acolyte,__ quinn __(lowes),__ is still practically shaking from the adrenaline boost of her first torture session under __huck's__ __tutelage.__ __lowes__ admits quinn "got a little bit of a taste for __[violence]__ in the __finale,"__ but says, "it's not so much that she wants to go out with a machine gun and start killing people. i don't think she's __psychotic,__ and that's not how i'm playing her. the deal is, she has had a lot of really terrible things happen to her in her life and, for the first time in a while, she was in control of the situation and she was __excelling__ at something and she was causing pain on somebody else. it's that sense of control that gives her a high, that forces her to be addicted to that feeling." kerry washington on how she stays grounded amid __'scandal'__ craze . even __lowes__ admits how wild __quinn's__ change in character has been. "i cannot go back and watch the pilot because we've come such a long way, and such a 180 has happened, and she's grown so much and changed so much as a person," she admits. "this season is a big mix. __darby__ is always saying, 'oh, that's old __quinn!__ oh, that's new __quinn!'__ now it's really combining together." for __huck,__ though, __quinn's__ new empowerment spells trouble. he considers himself a __murder-and-torture__ addict and now fears he's enabling __quinn.__ __dÃ­az__ __previews,__ "that's kind of what he's dealing with in the first few __episodes:__ him having created this monster. he knows how seductive it was for him and how __caught-up__ in it he got, in that dark world. he's afraid she's too far gone now, and he doesn't know what to do about it." however __huck__ chooses to confront __quinn's__ growing __bloodlust,__ it's safe to say __"huckleberry__ __quinn"__ â as __shippers__ affectionately refer to the friendship â will never be the same. according to __dÃ­az,__ that's not necessarily a bad thing: "their relationship has __shifted.__ it's changed a little bit. it's exciting what's coming down the __pike."__ __stanchfield's__ character is also facing a relationship in __flux__ with __on-and-off__ lover david rosen __(joshua__ __malina),__ the newly appointed u.s. attorney for the district of columbia. the pair had only a brief encounter in the premiere, with david telling abby to "return __[his]__ __calls,"__ but __stanchfield__ promises, "it's not over between abby and david. ... they try. the best way to describe it __[is],__ abby and david have never done normal â they've never actually been on a __proper,__ normal date. there's definitely an attempt at normal [in coming episodes __that]__ will be interesting for fans. it's been interesting to play. they really are two people who fit. they're a good match together because they're both sort of __misfits__ in a way." seeing as the beltway of "scandal" is packed with __misfits__ and __machinations,__ abby and david's __showmance__ will be in fine company â starting with a __huck-heavy__ episode next week.

(cnn) -- on wednesday some u.s. wireless carriers implemented the first part of a national strategy to deter cell phone __theft:__ a joint __"blacklist"__ database of identifying information about cell phones reported lost or stolen. as of now, cell phone dealers are supposed check this database before honoring requests to __reactivate__ allegedly __"locked-out"__ phones, in order to prevent people from using stolen phones. it used to be that when you reported a phone lost or stolen, your carrier would suspend service to that device. but the person who stole your phone (or someone who bought it from the __thief)__ could still walk into a cell phone dealer and get your phone __reactivated__ under a new account. chris __guttman-mccabe,__ vice president of regulatory affairs for __ctia__ (a global association of wireless __carriers),__ explained: "the point of the blacklist database is to dry up the __aftermarket__ for stolen phones. if you can't __reactivate__ a stolen phone, it's just a worthless __hunk__ of plastic and __metal."__ the fcc first announced this protect initiative in april to combat the theft of smartphones, tablets and the data they __contain.__ under this plan, u.s. carriers that use __gsm__ network technology (that's at&t and __t-mobile)__ committed to launching their databases by october 31. the other u.s. carriers, which operate __cdma-technology__ networks, still have over a year to get their __lost/stolen__ phone databases up and running (by november 30, __2013).__ according to __ctia,__ __sprint/nextel__ has already implemented its database. at first these __cdma__ databases will be __carrier-specific;__ later the __blacklists__ from all carriers will be integrated into a single database. carriers which have launched their blacklist databases are now working to educate phone dealers on how to access them. it's likely that phone dealerships operated by carriers will follow this process -- but educating and gaining cooperation from independently operated phone retailers will be more challenging. wireless carriers join forces to fight theft . "this will take time," __guttman-mccabe__ acknowledged. "i tend to see this as a glass half full. we're definitely making progress on fighting this problem, but it's not solved yet." in the meantime, carriers are stepping up their efforts to get cell phone users to protect their devices. public service announcements and other education efforts are under way to remind people to keep their cell phones and tablets locked with a password or pin code. these carrier efforts include web pages about phone security, mobile apps, e-mail information, bill __inserts,__ and more. some carriers such as at&t and device manufacturers such as apple offer a free __"remote__ __wipe"__ service -- allowing users to delete all data from a lost or stolen device to prevent data or identity theft. other carriers charge for this service, and most mobile security vendors, such as lookout or norton, offer remote wipe as part of an annual subscription service package. it is possible to forcibly unlock a phone that is locked with a password or __pin,__ but this is considerably more difficult for thieves and could act as a __deterrent.__ one factor slowing the implementation of a centralized __cross-carrier__ database of lost or stolen phones is the uneven pace of lte network __rollouts__ across the u.s. some of the identifying information listed in the database is derived from wireless networks, and variations in network technology make it difficult to create consistent and reliable listings for individual devices. so, while the carriers work to dry up the stolen phone __aftermarket,__ take a moment to set up remote wipe service for your phone, remember to keep it __locked,__ and beware of low-cost used phones available for sale on ebay, craigslist, and elsewhere. if you purchase a device that turns out to be stolen and therefore can't activate it, you won't get your money back. the opinions expressed in this post are solely those of amy gahran.

(cnn) -- __fehmi__ __khairullah,__ a __syrian-american__ doctor living in new jersey, says he cannot sleep these days. "the humanitarian situation in many parts of syria has reached its lowest point. it is so __horrific,"__ said __khairullah,__ who collects and delivers aid to syria. as violence escalates in the __sanctions-hit__ country and - - many argue -- the lack of government cooperation, humanitarian groups have been unable to reach those suffering the most in the country. even the international committee of the red cross & red __crescent,__ the only independent international aid agency operating inside syria, has not reached trapped citizens in devastated areas such as the baba amr neighborhood in the city of homs. last weekend, the aid group released a statement saying it started distributing aid to people in the restive city. but saleh __debaki,__ its __damascus-based__ spokesman, said thursday the aid is located at nine distribution centers around the city, but none has reached ravaged neighborhoods such as baba __amr.__ residents and activists in the neighborhood said friday they have not had any humanitarian aid reach them in more than a month. "it is the 13th days of shelling over our neighborhood," said abu omar, who was reached by satellite internet at a baba amr shelter. "we have not had any electricity, phone service, ... or even running water for weeks. we have not had any food or medical supplies either. we are so __desperate!__ there are only a few houses here that have water wells. that's our only access to any __water!"__ abu omar, who did not want to reveal his real name over safety fears, said the few dozen people staying at shelters in baba amr shower once every five days or so and limit other use of water to only drinking. khalil ahmed, another resident of baba __amr,__ said he has not seen any bread coming from outside the neighborhood in weeks. "that's why we decided to collect whatever flour we could find to bake some bread and share at the __shelters,"__ ahmed said. "we have no baby formula. parents put bread in water ... and that's what babies eat and __drink."__ there is only one medical facility in baba amr operating out of a basement of a mosque. it moved there because its last location was shelled in january, killing three __medics,__ according to mohamed __al-mohamed,__ one of a handful of doctors running the makeshift clinic using __"primitive__ __tools."__ back in the united states, __khairullah__ says the suffering will only get worse in many parts of syria unless there is a way to deliver humanitarian aid to those who need it most. shortly after the syrian uprising began on march 15, __khairullah__ and other __syrian-american__ professionals started the syria first coalition to collect donations and deliver them to affected families in the nation. "in light of the sanctions, we did not want to fall into any legal __traps.__ and we did not want to deal with the government's institutions. so we started paying influential businessmen inside syria in u.s. dollars and get food, water, blankets among other humanitarian items in return," __khairullah__ said. this worked for only a few months until no more businessman could risk doing that under the watchful eye of the regime, he said. so he identified financial institutions in turkey, jordan and lebanon -- to which the group transferred money in order to buy aid locally. the aid was then smuggled across the syrian borders. but with more and more limited safe passages into syria and a drying flow of cash, this option became even harder. the current sanctions allow transferring money to charitable groups in syria. "but how could we trust these government-sponsored syrian groups to oversee the distribution of __aid?'__ __khairullah__ said. a couple of international humanitarian groups such as the humanitarian relief for syria admit that they only go through syrian charity organizations to reach affected people inside the country. others -- such as islamic relief and __zakat__ foundation -- only reach out to syrian refugees in neighboring countries. "the only way to reach us in homs is through establishing safe __passages,"__ abu omar said. on the international level, france is trying to revive a plan it first introduced in november that tries to do just that. the idea is to provide safe access for relief organizations to deliver aid to affected populations through land border routes, a sea port or an airport - - all under the watch of international observers. but such a plan needs either syrian government approval or the backing of armed peacekeepers. in the latter case, a u.n. resolution may be needed. french foreign minister alain __juppÃÂ©__ discussed his government's "humanitarian __corridors"__ plan thursday with his russian counterpart, sergei lavrov, in order to avoid a veto on a possible u.n. security council resolution. the two met in vienna to reach a compromise despite moscow __vetoing__ a u.n. resolution based on an arab league proposal on feb. 4, according to russia's state-run __itar-tass.__ "we can possibly reach a compromise on a short-term __objective."__ __juppÃÂ©__ told reporters "we are ready to work in new york on a draft resolution inspired by the arab league to stop the violence and provide humanitarian __aid."__ lavrov was not committed to the plan and said more details are needed before an agreement, __itar__ __-tass__ reported. but many syrians seem to have no choice but to be optimistic as their tragedy plays out on the international stage. "i am __hopeful,"__ __khairulla__ said. "i am finally sensing change among international and regional powers regarding the suffering in syria ... and it is about __time!"__

(cnn) -- dutch fighter jets scrambled wednesday to intercept a pair of russian military aircraft that entered their airspace, a fairly routine action that comes amid heightened tensions between russia and nato, a dutch official said. maj. __wilko__ __ter__ __horst__ said that the military learned around __3:50__ p.m. __(9:50__ a.m. et) that two russian __tu-95__ bombers, known as bears, had come a half-mile inside its airspace. a pair of dutch f-16 military jets were then dispatched to escort the russian planes and "ensure they __(flew)__ out of our __airspace,"__ said __ter__ __horst,__ a dutch military spokesman. such a sequence of events isn't uncommon, with the netherlands military spokesman explaining "this is a national procedure when aircraft infringe __(on)__ national dutch __airspace."__ he estimated dutch fighter jets scramble to check out unknown aircraft -- be they from russia or another country -- about four or five times a year. "it is not unusual," __ter__ __horst__ added. "sometimes they cross dutch airspace and sometimes they stay north of dutch airspace (in the country's so-called area of __responsibility)."__ in this case, british military aircraft took over from the dutch in escorting the russian planes. a british defense ministry spokesman said that planes from his military left from royal air force station __leuchars__ "to determine the identity of unknown aircraft that approached the nato air policing area north of scotland and could not be identified by other means." these planes were later identified as the russian military planes. the spokesman stressed that they didn't enter british airspace, nor has any russian military plane ever done so. "the russian military aircraft remained in international airspace at all times, as they are perfectly entitled to do," the spokesman said. in a separate and __"standard"__ event, britain's hms dragon met up with the russian ship vice admiral __kulakov__ as it was __"transiting__ past the __uk,"__ according to the military spokesman. the british naval destroyer is now "keeping an eye on its transit south," he added. there was no immediate mention of this story on the english-language versions of at least two russian state-run media outlets, rt and ria novosti. while british defense secretary philip hammond said his military is always on alert "to intercept any __non-nato__ forces," he did not portray these specific incidents as __alarming.__ "recent events have increased awareness of russian military activity," hammond said. "but we have always routinely __intercepted,__ identified and escorted russian air and naval assets that transit international airspace and waters within the uk's __'area__ of __interest.'"__ both the netherlands and the united kingdom are part of nato, which has been increasingly at odds with russia over its activity in and around ukraine. the tensions ratcheted up late last year, when demonstrators pushed out ukraine's president in part due to their anger about his moving away from an alliance with europe and moving closer to russia. a pro-western government took over in kiev. soon after, the crimean peninsula __seceded__ from ukraine and became part of russia. since then, russia has deployed what nato estimates to be 40,000 troops near its border with ukraine, which has made other countries in the area nervous. in an interview wednesday with __rt,__ russian foreign minister sergey lavrov said that russia would "certainly __respond"__ if its interests were attacked in ukraine.

(cnn) -- the __new-look__ miami heat insist it is too early to judge their nba title credentials after losing their opening game of the season __88-80__ to the boston celtics on tuesday. in one of the most __highly-anticipated__ games in the series' history, the heat -- complete with their star trio of dwayne wade and new signings chris __bosh__ and lebron james -- could not live up to close season expectations against the 17-time nba finals champions. but james -- who announced his decision to leave the cleveland cavaliers to join miami in dramatic fashion on an hour-long television program on espn in july -- believes his new team can improve sufficiently before the end of the season in april next year.

miami (cnn) -- for politicians seeking public office, a stop at the iconic cafe versailles is a must. this little havana institution has become a symbol of the strength of the hispanic vote. here, cuban exiles have turned their conservative stance against the castro regime into a political force to be reckoned with in u.s. politics. "it forces politicians to learn __spanish,"__ said journalist julio cesar __camacho,__ "even if it's a few words." during a republican debate last week, rep. michele bachmann mentioned her visit to versailles as she tried to establish a rapport with hispanic voters. it was one of the first references to versailles in the nascent presidential campaign season, but it likely won't be the last. according to the 2010 census, the latino community is the fastest-growing segment of the u.s. population. the national association of latino elected and appointed officials estimates that, out of more than 50 million hispanics in the united states, 24 million will be eligible to vote next year. in south florida, many of those voters are latinos who are longtime residents of the region, but have been hoping to return to their countries of origin once the political and economic situation of the region changed, florida international university professor daniel alvarez said. as time goes on, those families are becoming increasingly active in politics -- taking a page from the cuban-american political __playbook,__ though not necessarily following their political views. in miami, alvarez said, 60% of __non-cuban__ hispanics are democrats. republican activist fabio andrade agrees. the __colombian-american,__ who chaired john mccain's 2008 presidential campaign in miami, said new voters of colombian descent are registering democrats at a __2-to-1__ __ratio.__ the tea party is part of the reason, he said. "some of the tea party views are too radical for __hispanics,"__ he said. that sentiment is echoed by __oswaldo__ __munoz,__ the publisher of el __venezolano__ newspaper. "the tea party message is not one hispanics want to hear, nor do we want to be the target of some of the ideas they __propose,"__ munoz said. according to alvarez, those ideas revolve around one issue that crosses country __loyalties:__ immigration. __"argentines,__ __colombians,__ __nicaraguans__ ... they all still identify themselves as immigrants, and the status of the immigrant is in peril right now due to the right-leaning tendencies in the country," he said. but conservative hispanic politicians fared very well in the last election -- some of them buoyed by the support of tea party loyalists. raul __labrador,__ now a congressman from idaho, was a voice for the tea party during the debt ceiling debate. in new mexico, susana martinez became the first latina governor in the u.s. with the support of sarah palin and tea party activists. in a recent interview, martinez told cnn the tea party has fiscal policies that are good for the country. "i think the tea party makes us think different and gives us more options from where to choose when it comes to electing __candidates,"__ martinez said. florida sen. marco rubio also rode the tea party wave that swept republicans into congress last year. but he has been criticized for his stance against illegal immigration, and alvarez said he's seen rubio trying to distance himself from the tea party. next year's elections will be a key indicator of whether tea party policies will drive latino voters into democrats' arms for years to come, alvarez said. but democrats in south florida aren't claiming victory just yet. joe garcia, a cuban-american democrat who lost a congressional bid last year, said conservative cubans are still the dominant force in south florida, and they will continue to be for the foreseeable future.

(cnn) -- a month ago, __elana__ meyers was hurtling down the sochi __bobsleigh__ track at 150 kph on her way to winning an olympic silver medal. now the 29-year-old has swapped the ice for a rugby ball as she sets out on her quest to be a summer olympian with the united states sevens team at the rio games in 2016. it's an ambitious bid -- meyers had never played the game until two weeks ago. "i'm offside all the time," she says __frankly.__ "i'm running ahead of the ball all the time. "the other problem is that with the __bobsleigh,__ i was used to just running in a straight line. that seems to be my default setting, and it doesn't work like that in rugby __sevens.__ it's a sharp learning __curve."__ meyers could have been forgiven for taking more time off after the olympics. with a bronze from vancouver four years ago, she had gone to sochi seeking gold with new partner __lauryn__ williams -- a track star who tasted success at london 2012 in the 4 x 100 meters relay and won 400m silver in 2004. in the end, they came __agonizingly__ close to victory, edged out by just one-tenth of a second after four runs on the olympic course by canadian duo __kaillie__ humphries and heather __moyse.__ it left meyers with her __demons.__ in the following days, she wrote on her blog: "every night, i'm haunted by that last run. i haven't slept much since it happened. i replay the __skids__ so vividly in my head that any thoughts of the other corners are reduced to a mere hazy memory. "so how does it feel to feel like you choked in front of the whole world? how does it feel to have your lifelong dream slip away literally from your __fingertips?__ it __sucks.__ was i too __exhausted?__ did i just finally hit my mental __limits?__ i don't know." the inquest into every painstaking moment of that final run -- the american duo's slowest by half a second -- has __dissipated__ in recent weeks, but meyers concedes "you still can't help going through what happened, what you might have done differently." she has allowed herself to increasingly dwell on the silver lining of sochi more often than asking "what __if?"__ thankfully, there has been barely been a chance to stop and think -- there were __welcome-home__ celebrations in georgia before she set out on her sevens mission, and meyers also has a wedding to plan. prior to traveling to russia, u.s. eagles coach ric __suggitt__ invited meyers to the us olympic training center __(otc)__ in california to test herself at __rugby.__ "a couple of girls on the __bobsleigh__ team had previously played rugby and made the __switch,"__ she says. "so i thought why can't i do it the other way around? "the coach asked me if i was interested in coming to practice and then come out after the olympics for a trial. i'd never tried it out before so i thought, 'why __not?'__ "even though i haven't played the game before, i think they looked at me and thought i was the right build. i'm a big girl -- i'm 175 __lbs__ and 5 foot 8 inches -- so i knew i wasn't worried about doing the hitting or getting hit. "i think i was just worried about not knowing the rules. it's been a case of out of the frying pan and into the fire, but it's been a __blast."__ the switch of sports is nothing new for her. her first sporting foray of note had been in softball and there were hopes of being selected for the u.s. team for the 2008 olympics. she missed out, and the sport was duly scrapped from the olympic schedule. by then, her focus had already switched to the __bobsleigh,__ an event she first tried out in 2007. it has brought her two olympic medals and two world titles, as well as a fiance -- fellow american __bobsledder__ nic taylor. the pair had been dating for two years when taylor took the decision to pop the question at the 2013 world championships in st. __moritz,__ with meyers standing on the podium. taylor had roses in his hand when he was handed the microphone by organizers, and he dropped to one knee. at the time, meyers __admitted:__ "it was such a shock. it was amazing." as if mastering a new sport wasn't enough, meyers is now planning a wedding for april 24. "it's been crazy but it's mostly planned. obviously the focus was on sochi so we were a little bit late out with the invitations but we're steadily getting the __rsvps__ in," she says. "i'm getting married at my parents' house. it's already been a great 2014 whatever happens with the rugby, and i'm pretty excited about the big day." the pressure is on meyers to play a remarkable game of __catchup__ with her fellow american rugby players as she attempts to marry her strengths to the requirements of the code -- a shortened version of the __15-a-side__ union format. but as an athlete nicknamed __"e-money"__ -- from her ability to deliver when it counts in the pressure situations -- she is confident she will get to grips with it. "if it goes well, it would be awesome to be part of the team in __rio,"__ she says. __"rio__ was the thing that got me interested and that's the very obvious goal. "but that's some way off. my legs were burning so much from that first week. it's not that i'm not fit but this is such a different level of fitness, there's so much __cardio.__ "but i'm optimistic that i'll get better ... a lot better. to get to rio would just be super crazy." in her sporting switch, she has had a useful ally in williams. __"lauryn__ talked about how special the summer games was, how huge it was," says __meyers.__ "she talked a lot about the pressure of being on the start line for the 100m final. "i've basically been asking her for as much information as possible. she's given me some good __advice."__ meyers has __oval-ball__ history -- her father used to play in the nfl for the atlanta __falcons,__ though his career was coming to an end when she was young. "if i'm honest, the thing i remember the most was the team mascot, freddie the __falcon,"__ she says laughing. "i really remember there was a mcdonald's nearby and i remember eating a __cheeseburger__ in the playground when the falcon appeared. i'm not sure my dad appreciates that being my favorite memory of him __playing."__ despite her new sporting __flirtation,__ meyers is not divorcing herself from the ice track just yet. "as we get closer to rio, i realize i may need to change my approach and focus more __solely,__ on __sevens,__ but i don't want to give up the __bobsleigh__ at the moment. i love it too much."

(cnn) -- president obama on tuesday outlined an ambitious agenda that requires "significant resources," even as he aims to __halve__ the deficit by the end of his first term. president obama says the united states will overcome . its current economic struggles. in his first speech to a joint session of congress, obama said it's time to act boldly not just to revive the economy, but "to build a new foundation for lasting __prosperity."__ "while the cost of action will be great, i can assure you that the cost of inaction will be far __greater,"__ he said. the president struck an optimistic tone, asserting that "we will rebuild, we will recover, and the united states of america will emerge stronger than before." obama focused on the three priorities of the budget he will present to congress later this week: energy, health care and education. the president said he sees his budget as a __"vision__ for america -- as a blueprint for our future," but not something that will solve every problem or address every issue. ____ watch obama lay out his plan to "save our children from __debt"__ Â» . "it reflects the stark reality of what we've inherited -- a trillion dollar deficit, a financial crisis, and a costly __recession,"__ he said. obama said his administration already has identified $2 trillion in government spending cuts that can be made over the next decade. ____ see video highlights of the speech, issue by issue Â» . the president touted the $787 billion stimulus plan he signed into law last week, saying it will invest in areas critical to the country's economic recovery. he also made bold promises for what these investments will achieve. obama predicted that because of the recovery plan, the united states will double its supply of renewable energy in the next three years. he also said the country will invest $15 billion a year to develop technology for green energy. ____ grade obama's speech Â» . obama also pledged a "historic __commitment"__ to health care and said the recovery plan could lead to a cure for cancer. he also promised the __"largest__ investment ever" in preventive care. on education, obama set a goal of having the highest college graduation rate in the world by 2020. he pointed to the billions for education -- from early childhood education expansion to __college-loan__ programs -- in the economic stimulus package to ensure that every child has access to education "from the day they are born to the day they begin a career." obama also said his budget will pay for more soldiers and marines, increase their pay and expand veterans health care and benefits. ireport.com: did obama really __deliver?__ obama said the recovery plans already in the works are immediate steps to revive the economy in the __short-term,__ "but the only way to fully restore america's economic strength is to make the long-term investments that will lead to new jobs, new industries, and a renewed ability to compete with the rest of the world." __"slowly,__ but surely, confidence will return, and our economy will __recover,"__ he said, asking congress to join him in "doing whatever proves necessary because we cannot __consign__ our nation to an open-ended __recession."__ obama promised to reform the regulatory system to "ensure that a crisis of this magnitude never happens again." the president also signaled that he was willing to take on __entitlements,__ saying that congress must take on the growing costs of medicare and social security. obama described the nation's financial woes as a __"reckoning"__ for poor decisions made by both government and individuals. ____ watch what obama says about the "day of __reckoning"__ Â» . "a surplus became an excuse to transfer wealth to the wealthy instead of an opportunity to invest in our future," obama said. __"regulations__ were gutted for the sake of a quick profit at the expense of a healthy market. people bought homes they knew they couldn't afford from banks and lenders who pushed those bad loans anyway. and all the while, critical debates and difficult decisions were put off for some other time on some other day." noting that is easy to "become cynical and __doubtful,"__ obama said he has learned that "hope is found in unlikely places." obama avoided lofty rhetoric and instead used examples of specific people to __personalize__ his points. __abess__ is a bank president from miami, florida, who reportedly cashed out of his company, took a $60 million bonus and distributed it among people who had worked for him. __bethea__ is an __eighth-grade__ girl from south carolina who, in a letter to lawmakers, asked for help for her school and said, "we are not __quitters."__ ____ watch obama talk about __bethea__ saying "we are not __quitters"__ Â» . while the economy was the focus of the speech, obama also touched on foreign policy. the president said he'll soon be laying out specifics on how to win the war in afghanistan and end the one in iraq. "we are now carefully reviewing our policies in both wars, and i will soon announce a way forward in iraq that leaves iraq to its people and responsibly ends this war," he said. ____ watch the entire speech Â» . meanwhile, he said, both afghanistan and its border with pakistan will remain a key focus. because obama's presidency is just a month old, the speech is not technically considered a state of the union address. the annual state of the union speech is delivered in the house of representatives before members of both the house and the senate as well as the justices of the supreme court, the president's cabinet and international __dignitaries.__ cnn's kristi keck contributed to this report.

(cnn) -- having been criticized by his great rival rafael nadal for not taking a stand over players' rights, roger federer began his bid for a fifth australian open title with a comfortable straight-sets victory on monday. the 16-time grand slam champion joined nadal in round two, matching the spaniard's smooth progress in melbourne with a 7-5 6-2 6-2 win over russia's alexander __kudryavtsev.__ world no. 172 __kudryavtsev,__ making his tournament debut, matched the swiss third seed early on as he battled to __5-5__ in the first set. but federer shrugged off __pre-tournament__ back concerns as he conceded only four more games to beat a player who won just three atp tour matches last year. the __30-year-old,__ whose last major title came in melbourne in 2010, will next play germany's __93rd-ranked__ andreas __beck.__ "i really tried to put in an effort to every point, play as hard as i could, first to see how the back felt, try to get into it, hopefully win, and then see how i feel tomorrow," federer said, before insisting his relationship with nadal had not been affected. "things are fine between us, you know. i have no hard feelings towards him. it's been a difficult last few months in terms of politics within the __atp,__ i guess, trying to find a new ceo and chairman. that can get frustrating sometimes. but for me, obviously nothing changes in terms of our relationship." his fellow former world no. 1 nadal came into the tournament having announced to international reporters that he would no longer be making statements about grievances over scheduling and pay. he then told spanish media on sunday that he thought atp player council president federer should take more of a public role over issues such as where the davis cup fits into the busy calendar. "his __(position)__ is __easy:__ do not say anything, all positive, i am a __'gentleman,'__ others get burned. we each have our opinion and maybe he likes the circuit. me too, i like it, and i think it's better than most sports. that does not mean you cannot be better and that you should change things that are bad," the 25-year-old said ahead of monday's 6-4 6-1 6-1 win over __ukraine-born__ american qualifier alex __kuznetsov.__ "i say a lot of good things about tennis, because thanks to this sport i have had experiences in my life i could never have dreamed of, but to finish your career with pain in all areas of your body is not positive. "he finishes his career as fresh as a daisy because he is physically __privileged,__ but neither murray nor djokovic and i are fresh as a __daisy."__ nadal, the 2009 champion, had hoped he was over his injury problems going into the two-week event, but revealed after his opening win that he needed an mri scan after hurting his right knee yet again in practice.

atlanta, georgia (cnn) -- joshua __packwood__ knows what it's like to be a minority. joshua __packwood,__ 22, will be the first white __valedictorian__ at the historically black morehouse college. this weekend he'll be the first white __valedictorian__ to graduate from the historically black, all male morehouse college in the school's __141-year__ history. __morehouse,__ in atlanta, georgia, is one the nation's most prestigious universities of its kind. for more than a century, the school has __prided__ itself on __personifying__ the dream of the rev. martin luther king jr., one of the school's most notable __alums,__ by producing __"morehouse__ men" - intelligent and successful black leaders. "because i'm one of the only white students, it's easy to call me 'the white __boy,'__ i'm naturally going to stand out," says __packwood.__ but __packwood,__ 22, doesn't stand out solely because he is white or has maintained a __4.0__ grade point average. for those who don't know him, what is surprising is that a rhodes scholar finalist turned down a full scholarship to columbia university to attend the __all-black__ men's university. this came naturally to __packwood,__ who attended a predominantly black high school. "a large majority of my friends, like all my girlfriends have been __minorities,"__ says __packwood.__ "so it was very, it was kind of strange that i always kind of __gravitated__ to the black community." __packwood__ fit in immediately at __morehouse.__ his charm, __movie-star__ good looks and chiseled physique made him popular among students. he was elected dorm president and to class council during freshmen year - and was a favorite at campus fashion shows. ____ white __valedictorian__ makes history Â» . he also gained __worldly__ experience studying and traveling abroad. life hasn't always been easy for __packwood.__ he grew up in a poor area of kansas city, missouri, where he says he found himself __gravitating__ to the black community at a young age. adolescence was rough. his mother's second marriage to a black man ended in divorce and family tension forced him to seek refuge with his best friend's family - who were black and __middle-class.__ the experience of living with his best friend's family had a profound effect on __packwood,__ who says he saw a "different side of black america." during his teens, __packwood__ says he got into his share of fights and even landed in jail a few times. still, his grades were good and eventually earned him a full scholarships to morehouse college and columbia university. against the advice of some family members, __packwood__ gave up the scholarship to an ivy league school. he felt the true college experience was at morehouse - where he believed he would get more than an education. "i gained this interest in african-american studies and i thought that morehouse would probably be the best experience," says __packwood.__ "i think of it in terms of __'study__ __abroad.'__ if i really want to learn it, if i really want to understand it - maybe it's best if i immerse myself in the culture." "mr. __packwood__ is __deserving.__ he has earned this," says dr. robert franklin, the president of __morehouse.__ "we are committed to merit, to hard work - no matter who it might be." for the most part, __packwood__ says the experience among his morehouse __brethren__ has been overwhelmingly good - with the exception of a few negative comments. "one guy came up to me and told me -- he didn't like the fact that i was here," recalls __packwood.__ "he absolutely didn't like the fact that i dated black women." "so i heard him out, and said, 'i appreciate your opinion but don't agree with what you have to __say,'...and__ now we've become, not necessarily close, but very cool," __packwood__ says. that student, vinson muhammad, says he was curious about the reasons why someone like __packwood__ would choose to attend an __all-black__ college.

"i think that it should be a wake-up call to an all black campus," says __muhammad.__ "at morehouse we're supposed to be at the top as black men. we only have a few white students and to see a white student will rise to this - is something unsettling to me because it shows that we need to work __harder."__ campus administrators say that black or white, __packwood's__ experience is consistent with the school's mission: to produce future leaders.

"the interesting thing about __josh's__ experience is that he had a full morehouse experience," says __hudson.__ "when he marches across the stage on may 18 and receives his __diploma,__ he's going to be a morehouse man in every way -- except __ethnicity."__ "i don't think ethnicity makes the __difference;__ it's what's in his heart." jackie adams and allen __huntspon__ contributed to this report.

(cnn) -- roger federer kept his gold medal dream alive after a marathon semifinal battle with argentina's juan martin del potro at wimbledon friday. federer had to dig deep to beat the former u.s. open champion 3-6 7-6 __19-17__ in four hours 26 minutes, the longest match in olympic tennis history. he will play home hope andy murray, a repeat of last month's wimbledon final, after the briton swept aside novak djokovic 7-5 7-5 in the second semifinal. a single break in each set was enough to give murray his chance for revenge and gold. "i know how much winning tonight meant to me. it was one of the biggest matches of my career, one of the biggest wins of my career," murray told bbc sport. "it was one of the most emotional i've been after a match. i'm so happy to win. you don't see me smiling that much __normally.__ i haven't stopped smiling since i came off the court.

"i don't think i've ever played as long a set in a best of three match," he told gathered reporters. "it was very physical at the end and so __mental.__ i got lucky in the second set to get back and then in the third it was so tough," he added. world no.1 federer is bidding to become the third man after rafael nadal and andre agassi to complete a career golden slam of the four grand slam titles and an olympic singles title. his wimbledon triumph over murray was his 17th grand slam title but he has now claimed his first medal in singles competition in the olympics. he won doubles gold with stanislas wawrinka for switzerland in beijing in 2008. the women's singles final will be a mouth watering clash between serena williams of the united states and russian maria __sharapova.__ sharapova beat compatriot maria kirilenko 6-2 6-3, while williams thrashed women's no.1 victoria azarenka of belarus 6-1 6-2 in just 63 minutes. sharapova is competing in the games for the first time and is also seeking a golden grand slam, but faces in williams an opponent in ominous form after winning at wimbledon last month.

(cnn) -- among the entertainers who have donated their energies to the uso in recent years are stephen colbert, jon stewart, scarlett __johansson,__ kid rock, __queensryche,__ toby __keith,__ lewis black and robin williams. stephen colbert's trip to iraq, facilitated by the __uso,__ was six months in the planning. but when the uso conducts a public opinion survey asking people who they think of when the military service organization is mentioned, one name always comes up. "the first thing out of their mouths is __'bob__ __hope,'__ " said mark phillips, the __uso's__ vice president for communications, with an audible __shrug.__ "and if they're not part of the military, the list stops there." as the country celebrates independence day and pays tribute to the men and women who serve in its armed forces, the uso is trying to change that mindset. the organization, which was founded in 1941 to bring comfort and entertainment to america's men and women in uniform, has been focusing its support on american troops stationed around the world, particularly those in the military theaters of iraq and afghanistan, said phillips. as part of that initiative, it's paying a great deal of attention to the troops' __desires,__ whether they be for high technology -- the uso recently brought video __game/hdtv__ entertainment centers and __satellite-based__ telephone systems to some areas -- or a diversity of __entertainers,__ including rappers and nfl players. the colbert trip was a meeting of the minds between the comedy central star and the military, said rachel __tischler,__ the __uso's__ vice president for entertainment operations. the __"colbert__ report" host, who has __attested__ to his interest in iraq in such venues as newsweek magazine (he was a guest editor last __month),__ expressed interest in going, a request that made its way up the chain of command to gen. david petraeus, the former leader of coalition forces in iraq. petraeus liked the idea, said __tischler,__ and the principals were put in touch with the __uso.__ colbert's __excursion,__ which the comedian called "operation iraqi __stephen,"__ was unusual for the __uso,__ she added. "we try to keep our footprint small," she said, noting that the organization is reliant on the military to feed and house its guests. in __"colbert's"__ case, the footprint was considerably __larger:__ colbert's staff and several uso employees -- not to mention 150 volunteers. the trip required six months of planning. but the broadcasts went well, with colbert paying tribute to the military and the __uso's__ volunteers (as well as his own __staff)__ on the __"report."__ he also put in a plug for uso __donations:__ "the uso does more than bring my show to __baghdad,"__ colbert said on the show. "they also deliver much-needed care packages to the __troops."__ __(whereupon,__ in a __care-package__ __primer,__ colbert and tom hanks filled a box with shaving __gel,__ tang and a demolished ice __sculpture.)__ the group remains greatly dependent on the kindness of strangers, said phillips. "we're primarily a volunteer organization," he said, noting the uso has fewer than 400 paid employees and 25,000 volunteers. though the uso does receive a small congressional appropriation -- $20 million in 2008 -- much of its funding comes from individuals, corporations and in the form of __in-kind__ services. jamie __masada,__ the owner of los angeles' laugh factory comedy club, said the organization is close to his heart. he followed a tour of laugh factory comedians with an invitation to service members to visit his club. "what we try to do is give the soldiers -- the people that are out there putting their lives on the line for our country ... we try to say, one day if you come to los angeles, if you want to be a comedian, our door is open to you. we want you to send us some material, some __jokes,"__ he said. at a recent uso fundraiser, five service members were given the opportunity to compete for the title of __"funniest__ service __member."__ the group was given advice from several notable __comedians,__ including tom __dreesen__ and paul rodriguez, and the winner received cash, gift certificates and a performance at the club, complete with name on the __marquee.__ a number of performers return again and again. toby keith has gone on at least seven uso __tours;__ "he insists on going to the __smallest,__ most remote places," said phillips. actor gary __sinise__ and his lt. dan band are also frequent participants. "there aren't enough words to describe just how grateful i am to our nation's troops," said keith in a press release before this year's tour. "i've participated in several uso tours over the years and i've seen firsthand their sacrifice. and i will not stop doing all i can to show my support and lift their __spirits."__ many entertainers shy away from publicity, particularly on the home front. "we have celebrities come to __bethesda__ naval hospital, walter reed ... and they almost always insist we don't talk about [the __visits],"__ said __tischler.__ at its core, phillips said, the uso remains dedicated to the needs of u.s. service members. __"service__ members in iraq and afghanistan are frequently at small, remote __bases,"__ said phillips.

one of the most prominent developers of the plan that could shut the government down is a little-known congressman who has been in office only eight months. this newly elected tea party aligned lawmaker __downplays__ his position, saying he has relatively little influence. but in reality, his efforts have pushed washington to the __brink.__ at issue is the affordable care act, also known as obamacare. some republicans are demanding that it be dismantled -- or at the very least delayed - and they think the best way to do that is attach it to a __must-pass__ bill to fund the government. the idea has rankled washington for more than a week and exposed __fissures__ in the republican party. so who is the lawmaker quietly influencing the __debate?__ sen. ted cruz, who staged a __21-hour__ __talk-a-thon__ on the senate floor disparaging obamacare, would be a good guess. but it would be wrong. the persuasive . the __answer?__ mark meadows, who represents the western part of north carolina and has wielded his influence behind the bright lights of the television cameras and the hot __microphones.__ in august, while lawmakers spent time in their districts, meadows wrote a letter to his republican leaders suggesting they tie the dismantling of obamacare to the bill that funds the government for the next year. the letter read: "james madison wrote in __federalist__ no. 58 that 'the power over the purse may, in fact, be regarded as the most complete and __effectual__ __weapon...__ for obtaining a redress of every __grievance...'"__ meadows successfully convinced 79 of his colleagues to sign on to his letter. ____ and he went further, leading a group of 40 lawmakers to demand that the continuing resolution, or the short-term government funding bill at issue, __zeroes__ out funding for president barack obama's signature domestic policy achievement so far. republican divisions force delay in boehner's debt strategy . in a lengthy interview with cnn, meadows explained his case. "our intent has never been to shut down the government," meadows said. "it's to stop the __[health__ __care]__ law." senate majority leader harry reid called those advocating for such a plan __"anarchists."__ a "bad day for government is a good day for the tea party," reid said on the senate floor last week. meadows vs. the gop . republican leaders in the house were reluctant and dismissed the plan -- at first. speaker john boehner and many republicans believed the strategy could lead to shutdown as the democratic-led senate would never agree to such a plan. additionally, leaders believed that republicans would be blamed for a shut down. polling backs up their concern. a recent cnn/orc international poll indicated that 51% of respondents would blame republicans. that's a political risk that leadership didn't want to risk. even though __meadows'__ letter doesn't represent a majority of the caucus, it was a factor in persuading boehner to reverse course and put forward a plan that funds the government but __defunds__ obamacare. running against politics . meadows said he understands that __"leadership__ has a different responsibility." and that leadership is responsible for thinking about the party. "this type of vote could potentially hurt our long term goals. i understand that," he said. but he said that's not his concern. "my job first is to make sure i represent the people back home," meadows said. "i don't believe that when i get here that people expect me to look at the political implications. that's for somebody else to focus on." for him, getting rid of obamacare is priority no. 1. __"[t]o__ ignore that would be to ignore our duty to represent the people back home," he said. __'persona__ non __grata'__ "for me it's about representing the __749,000__ people i was elected to __represent,"__ meadows told cnn in his small capitol hill office. he said his constituents want him to fight against obamacare "regardless of consequences." meadows represents a conservative __constituency.__ he was elected in 2012 and succeeded democrat heath __shuler,__ who decided not to run for reelection after the latest round of redistricting made the district swing heavily republican. meadows won by 15 percentage points. republican presidential candidate mitt romney won the district with 61% of the vote, an impressive outcome in a state he won by 1 point. exclusive: romney disagrees with house gop __'tactics'__ on obamacare . but there's more to the story. meadows works very closely with the tea party groups and he is a conduit to their agenda. in fact, his __catapult__ from local businessman to elected official was launched with the help of local tea party groups. he underwent a vigorous interview process with the north __carolina-aligned__ tea party groups that included an intense vetting and interviewing process. jane __bilello,__ head of the asheville, north carolina, tea party group and its separate political action committee, said it is to ensure candidates "truly represents who we are and what we want them to do." __bilello__ is pleased with __meadows'__ job performance so far. she said meadows is "turning out to be our poster boy." on the issue of obamacare, "he truly represents us," __bilello__ said. well-funded national tea __party-aligned__ organizations, such freedom works, are also watching closely. like __bilello's__ organization, they hold lawmakers accountable. not only do they keep __scorecards__ of how lawmakers vote on legislation, they are keeping track of what letters they sign on to and their role in every step of the legislative process. republican leaders are well aware of the influence of these organizations. republican rep. lee terry of nebraska, who was elected in 1998 and finds himself between the new generation of tea __party-aligned__ groups and the more traditional republican leadership, said the tea party groups __"impacts__ everybody." __billelo__ said that meadows hosts conference calls with the groups' members to explain what's happening in congress, including the challenges that he faces promoting their agenda. she said he told them he's __"persona__ non __grata"__ around the halls of congress. __bilello__ said she and her members remind him: "they don't elect you. we do." they also offer __assurance:__ "we have your back. we will support you," __bilello__ said she tells him. meadows relayed a similar sentiment. "there's nobody in washington, d.c., who ever voted for me and there's no one in washington, d.c., who will ever vote for me," meadows said. "so it's about representing the people back home." the __non-leadership__ leader . "i think everybody wants me to pick a fight with leadership," meadows said. but he contended that he isn't about playing the __rebel,__ but finding results. are his tactics __working?__ meadows said yes. "the senate for the first time is having to vote ... on __obamacare,"__ meadows said. "that's why we had to do this." the house has now voted 42 times on either defunding or repealing all or parts of obamacare. many republicans in the senate thought the idea was a lost cause, including texas republican john cornyn, who said friday that the strategy "won't work." the senate eliminated the health care portion of the bill on friday before sending a revised spending plan back to the house for consideration over the weekend. a shutdown would occur tuesday, if there is no spending plan in place. but meadows successfully convinced a reluctant boehner to go along with his plan. and then after it became clear the senate wasn't going to play ball, the speaker hoped to move past the fight and pass a funding bill that would be able to pass the senate, meaning it wouldn't defund health care. but boehner's republican caucus, once again with meadows in the __forefront,__ rejected that plan. boehner's now working on a plan that will appease members such as __meadows.__ what do shutdown and debt limit have to do with __obamacare?__ meanwhile, meadows vowed to hold his ground. "if there is a real plan to make sure we can accomplish it through some other means, i'm willing to look at that," he said. but he said it must involve "at least __delaying"__ the implementation of obamacare. if it doesn't, he is willing to buck his leadership and oppose any bill he doesn't think goes far enough. he admits some will have to take "some tough __votes"__ to take. but for him he's right where his constituents want him to be. "it's a safe place for me to be," meadows said. polarizing washington . meadows rejected the idea that he is adding to the gridlock in washington. he said washington politicians have lost their way, but it's not because of their inability to compromise. __"pragmatism__ has been at the cost of principle and principle has been at the cost of __pragmatism,"__ he said. still, meadows asserted that he is willing to compromise with the democrats. "my ultimate success will be viewed by whether there is something we can __accomplish,"__ he said.

urumqi, china (cnn) ____ -- reports of alleged syringe stabbings in a restive western chinese city are generating a bit of panic, but doctors say some people have incorrectly concluded they were attacked with __needles.__ people's armed police units equipped with armored personnel carriers take positions in urumqi on saturday. "in the patients we have seen in the last couple of days, there are many which we believe were not actually punctured with __needles,"__ wang __hanbin,__ a peoples' liberation army doctor examining people in urumqi, told reporters on saturday at a briefing. wang said about 20 cases are being investigated closely and samples were being taken to laboratories in beijing for more testing. but, he said, "many of the patients we have seen were mainly influenced by psychological __factors."__ wang, a member of a __six-person__ military medical panel reviewing the __syringe-stabbing__ claims, attributes the false reports to widespread fear and lack of medical knowledge. "many of the patients did not actually see their attacker or the act of others attacking them with __needles.__ some patients who had needle puncture wounds experienced some discomfort in the area of the wound, and showed some symptoms, but couldn't give an accurate account of what they perceived to have been a needle attack." this is the latest crisis plaguing xinjiang province and its capital city of urumqi, where tensions have boiled over between uyghurs and han chinese. the han chinese are the country's dominant ethnic group, and the uyghurs are a __turkic-speaking__ muslim minority who consider xinjiang their homeland. ethnic uyghurs have been blamed for the alleged syringe __stabbings,__ and demonstrators clashed with police in urumqi for two days this week over the issue. protesters were demanding better police protection and a crackdown on the __uyghurs.__ the latest unrest left five people dead and 14 injured, according to __urumqi's__ deputy mayor, and the communist party chief in the city has been dismissed from his job amid the crisis, according to state-run media reported. ____ watch report on unrest in urumqi from cnn's john __vause__ Â» . the urumqi public prosecutors office on saturday said four ethnic uyghurs were arrested in connection with three __syringe-wielding__ incidents. at the press conference held by military medical personnel, the doctors said puncture wounds could not be found "in a large percentage of the patients." "some could have been bitten by insects such as __mosquitoes,__ and in other cases there were __moles,__ or skin __pigmentation,__ and we couldn't find a needle puncture __wound,"__ said wang, speaking at the news conference. "maybe they heard something from someone, then they discovered that they had a growth on their body. so, then they suspect that they may have been attacked with a needle and came to seek treatment. some patients who came to seek treatment had some red marks or rash on their skin, but we didn't find any needle puncture __wounds."__ wang urged people not to panic and urged them to immediately seek medical treatment if they think they were __stabbed.__ he also said people need to educate themselves about medical care. rumors have __abounded__ in urumqi of recent syringe __stabbers__ trying to spread aids and other diseases. but another doctor, __duan__ __qing,__ explained at the briefing that would be impossible for there to be any such cases of aids, hepatitis b, hepatitis c, or __syphilis__ because there is a lengthy incubation period. "even if there are cases of such illnesses, they are unrelated to incidents. this is basic medical knowledge," she said. the three incidents that led to the arrests occurred in late august. a man admitted stabbing a female shopper with a pin on august 28. authorities said a man and woman on august 29 stole money from a taxi driver after threatening him with a __syringe.__ and in the third incident, a man resisting arrest stabbed a police officer with a syringe on august 31.

johannesburg (cnn) -- a man, struggling to get away, is surrounded by south african police in the middle of a street as a large crowd looks on. the officers pull him over to a police van and handcuff his hands, over his head, to the back of the vehicle as he sits on the ground. soon, as some in the crowd __scream,__ the van begins to move. it slowly picks up speed. the helpless man in a red t-shirt is dragged along the road. soon, two officers lift him up by the legs, apparently to avoid dragging -- but the police van seems to speed up, and the man's legs fall to the ground, he is dragged hundreds of feet. south africa shocked by police shootings at mine . though injured, the man was never taken to a hospital, police investigators say. he died a few hours after the incident. the suspected cause of death: head wounds. the video, captured by someone in the crowd in __daveyton,__ near johannesburg, has sparked fury over police brutality in the country. "we are shocked by this incident," said moses __dlamini,__ a spokesman for the police investigative __directorate,__ an independent government agency that looks into possible crimes by police. but such a scene may not be all that rare. the directorate received more than 6,000 complaints accusing police of numerous crimes, including murder and torture, during a one-year period from early 2011 to early 2012. the cases include __648__ deaths. the u.s. state department's human rights report on south africa for 2011, the latest year available, said the country's __"principal__ human rights problems included police use of lethal and excessive force, including torture, against suspects and detainees, which resulted in deaths and __injuries;__ vigilante and mob violence; and prison overcrowding and abuse of prisoners, including beatings and rape by prison __guards."__ but __dlamini__ was quick to emphasize that in the nation of 50 million people, police who carry out crimes do not reflect the police service as a whole. "there are many other officers who are __dedicated,__ who uphold the law and arrest criminals all the time," he said. while authorities have not confirmed the man's identity, local reports say he was a taxi driver from __mozambique.__ the man and the police in the video, as well as those in the crowd, are black, so there is no suggestion that the incident is a sign of white vs. black tensions in the country. "this appalling incident involving excessive force is the latest in an increasingly disturbing pattern of brutal police conduct in south africa," said noel __kututwa,__ amnesty international's southern africa director. johan __burger,__ a senior researcher with the institute for security studies in pretoria, said some police officers think they "are above the law" and that there won't be consequences for their actions. south africa's history of violence "is part and parcel of daily life," he said. some think "the best way to deal with this is to act in a brutal way." cnn's nkepile mabuse reported from __johannesburg;__ cnn's josh levs reported from atlanta.

the united states is on the verge of an energy __renaissance.__ we need to recognize and seize the opportunity. this renaissance involves domestic production of natural resources ranging from clean renewables to __hydrocarbons.__ in particular, domestic __hydrocarbon__ production -- both oil and gas -- is increasing dramatically, with some experts predicting that the united states could become the largest __hydrocarbon__ producer in the word -- __outstripping__ saudi arabia and russia -- by 2020. increased domestic production of __hydrocarbons__ is driven by two trends. first, new technology is unlocking unconventional resources such as __shale-derived__ oil and gas. and second, investors and policy makers are recognizing that the u.s. still has an enormous resource base of conventional oil and gas, particularly in alaska. opinion: why we should look to the arctic . federal agencies estimate that alaska's north slope and federal waters off alaska's northern coast contain approximately 40 billion barrels of technically __recoverable__ oil and more than 200 trillion cubic feet of conventional gas. according to the u.s. geological survey, this region contains more oil than any comparable region located in the arctic, including northern russia. however, the united states is lagging behind its arctic neighbors in developing these resources. this is unfortunate, because we have some of the highest environmental standards in the world and we should be setting the bar for arctic development. developing our arctic resources will promote our nation's interests in many ways: securing a politically stable, long-term supply of domestic __energy;__ boosting u.s. economic growth and __jobs;__ reducing the federal trade __deficit;__ and strengthening our global leadership on energy issues. leading academic researchers and economists in alaska have estimated that oil production from alaska's outer continental shelf will bring federal revenues of approximately __$167__ billion over 50 years, and create 55,000 jobs throughout the country. developing u.s. resources in the arctic has the added benefit of enhancing global environmental protection. one of the arguments used by arctic drilling opponents is that "we aren't ready," but it is obvious that no matter what preparations are made, they will argue that it isn't enough. shell, for example, has spent billions to prepare for drilling in the arctic this summer, incorporating the lessons learned from the deepwater horizon spill in the gulf of mexico, state-of-the-art equipment and extensive scientific research. recently, the obama administration has __publically__ expressed its confidence in the company's drilling plans. the u.s. has created some of the highest standards in the world for environmental protection. when we delay or __disallow__ responsible resource development, the end result is not to protect the environment, but to drive __hydrocarbon__ investment and production to countries with much lower environmental standards and enforcement capacity. last year, it was reported that between 5 million and 20 million tons of oil leak in russia per year. this is equivalent to a deepwater horizon blowout about every two months. russia had an estimated 18,000 oil pipeline __ruptures__ in 2010 -- the figure for the u.s. that year was __341.__ if we do not pursue responsible development in the arctic, countries such as russia -- perhaps even china, which is interested in securing access to arctic __hydrocarbon__ resources -- will dominate energy production from the arctic. ____ such a scenario does not bode well for the global environment. by embracing the opportunities in the arctic, the united states will show the world that it can be a strong leader in responsible energy development.

(cnn) -- someone went into a large __roost__ of __blackbirds__ in __beebe,__ arkansas, as the clock struck midnight saturday and set off fireworks, contributing to the deaths of scores of __blackbirds,__ a state wildlife spokeswoman said. last new year's eve, roughly 5,000 birds were found dead in a __square-mile__ area in __beebe,__ a central arkansas town about 35 miles northeast of little rock through which birds migrate and that is home to a large __roost__ for the birds. fireworks last year caused otherwise healthy birds to become disoriented and __"fly__ all over the place" into stationary objects, such as trees and buildings, arkansas game and fish commission spokeswoman __ginny__ porter said. those __birds'__ deaths were likely "not __intentional,"__ porter added. but questions remain about the intention of the person or persons who set off fireworks that killed about 200 __blackbirds__ this weekend. in light of the fatalities one year earlier, a state wildlife officer and beebe police officers were patrolling the area mindful of the dangers that fireworks posed to the __blackbirds,__ the wildlife spokesman noted. even so, 50 birds died when fireworks went off around 7 p.m. saturday, said porter, who added, "we don't know where or who shot them __(fireworks)."__ the majority of the __blackbird__ deaths occurred five hours later at midnight, in a bunch of trees, or __roost,__ in a residential area.

(cnn) -- a month ago, __elana__ meyers was hurtling down the sochi __bobsleigh__ track at 150 kph on her way to winning an olympic silver medal. now the 29-year-old has swapped the ice for a rugby ball as she sets out on her quest to be a summer olympian with the united states sevens team at the rio games in 2016. it's an ambitious bid -- meyers had never played the game until two weeks ago. "i'm offside all the time," she says __frankly.__ "i'm running ahead of the ball all the time. "the other problem is that with the __bobsleigh,__ i was used to just running in a straight line. that seems to be my default setting, and it doesn't work like that in rugby __sevens.__ it's a sharp learning __curve."__ meyers could have been forgiven for taking more time off after the olympics. with a bronze from vancouver four years ago, she had gone to sochi seeking gold with new partner __lauryn__ williams -- a track star who tasted success at london 2012 in the 4 x 100 meters relay and won 400m silver in 2004. in the end, they came __agonizingly__ close to victory, edged out by just one-tenth of a second after four runs on the olympic course by canadian duo __kaillie__ humphries and heather __moyse.__ it left meyers with her __demons.__ in the following days, she wrote on her blog: "every night, i'm haunted by that last run. i haven't slept much since it happened. i replay the __skids__ so vividly in my head that any thoughts of the other corners are reduced to a mere hazy memory. "so how does it feel to feel like you choked in front of the whole world? how does it feel to have your lifelong dream slip away literally from your __fingertips?__ it __sucks.__ was i too __exhausted?__ did i just finally hit my mental __limits?__ i don't know." the inquest into every painstaking moment of that final run -- the american duo's slowest by half a second -- has __dissipated__ in recent weeks, but meyers concedes "you still can't help going through what happened, what you might have done differently." she has allowed herself to increasingly dwell on the silver lining of sochi more often than asking "what __if?"__ thankfully, there has been barely been a chance to stop and think -- there were __welcome-home__ celebrations in georgia before she set out on her sevens mission, and meyers also has a wedding to plan. prior to traveling to russia, u.s. eagles coach ric __suggitt__ invited meyers to the us olympic training center __(otc)__ in california to test herself at __rugby.__ "a couple of girls on the __bobsleigh__ team had previously played rugby and made the __switch,"__ she says. "so i thought why can't i do it the other way around? "the coach asked me if i was interested in coming to practice and then come out after the olympics for a trial. i'd never tried it out before so i thought, 'why __not?'__ "even though i haven't played the game before, i think they looked at me and thought i was the right build. i'm a big girl -- i'm 175 __lbs__ and 5 foot 8 inches -- so i knew i wasn't worried about doing the hitting or getting hit. "i think i was just worried about not knowing the rules. it's been a case of out of the frying pan and into the fire, but it's been a __blast."__ the switch of sports is nothing new for her. her first sporting foray of note had been in softball and there were hopes of being selected for the u.s. team for the 2008 olympics. she missed out, and the sport was duly scrapped from the olympic schedule. by then, her focus had already switched to the __bobsleigh,__ an event she first tried out in 2007. it has brought her two olympic medals and two world titles, as well as a fiance -- fellow american __bobsledder__ nic taylor. the pair had been dating for two years when taylor took the decision to pop the question at the 2013 world championships in st. __moritz,__ with meyers standing on the podium. taylor had roses in his hand when he was handed the microphone by organizers, and he dropped to one knee. at the time, meyers __admitted:__ "it was such a shock. it was amazing." as if mastering a new sport wasn't enough, meyers is now planning a wedding for april 24. "it's been crazy but it's mostly planned. obviously the focus was on sochi so we were a little bit late out with the invitations but we're steadily getting the __rsvps__ in," she says. "i'm getting married at my parents' house. it's already been a great 2014 whatever happens with the rugby, and i'm pretty excited about the big day." the pressure is on meyers to play a remarkable game of __catchup__ with her fellow american rugby players as she attempts to marry her strengths to the requirements of the code -- a shortened version of the __15-a-side__ union format. but as an athlete nicknamed __"e-money"__ -- from her ability to deliver when it counts in the pressure situations -- she is confident she will get to grips with it. "if it goes well, it would be awesome to be part of the team in __rio,"__ she says. __"rio__ was the thing that got me interested and that's the very obvious goal. "but that's some way off. my legs were burning so much from that first week. it's not that i'm not fit but this is such a different level of fitness, there's so much __cardio.__ "but i'm optimistic that i'll get better ... a lot better. to get to rio would just be super crazy." in her sporting switch, she has had a useful ally in williams. __"lauryn__ talked about how special the summer games was, how huge it was," says __meyers.__ "she talked a lot about the pressure of being on the start line for the 100m final. "i've basically been asking her for as much information as possible. she's given me some good __advice."__ meyers has __oval-ball__ history -- her father used to play in the nfl for the atlanta __falcons,__ though his career was coming to an end when she was young. "if i'm honest, the thing i remember the most was the team mascot, freddie the __falcon,"__ she says laughing. "i really remember there was a mcdonald's nearby and i remember eating a __cheeseburger__ in the playground when the falcon appeared. i'm not sure my dad appreciates that being my favorite memory of him __playing."__ despite her new sporting __flirtation,__ meyers is not divorcing herself from the ice track just yet. "as we get closer to rio, i realize i may need to change my approach and focus more __solely,__ on __sevens,__ but i don't want to give up the __bobsleigh__ at the moment. i love it too much."

"china cannot afford to alienate __malaysia,"__ said another chinese source who asked not to be named.

washington (cnn) -- the navy seal who says he shot and killed osama bin laden says he is worried the pentagon might prosecute him for publicly telling his story of the may 2011 raid on the al qaeda leader's compound in pakistan. but robert o'neill said the value of sharing the details of the mission for the families of the september 11, 2001, victims and military veterans killed in the ensuing wars makes that risk __worthwhile.__ "i think i did this in a way that doesn't violate any tactics or any rules," he said in an interview on cnn's "the __lead"__ with jake __tapper.__ being prosecuted, he said, "does concern me, and if it comes up, i'll address it." in his most extensive live television interview to date, o'neill said he realized the power of his story while speaking with a group that included about 20 families of victims of the september 11 attacks. he said it was the first time he'd really spoken about the mission, and that men and women cried and told him "it was closure for them." at that moment, he said, he realized the importance of sharing what he could -- and that he needed to find a way to do so "with respect for the tactics, for the safety of our troops and for the department of defense." responding to criticisms from former administration officials and current __servicemembers__ that he shouldn't be talking publicly, o'neill said, "i think it's important historically for this to get out there."

"the chances of us not coming back were a lot greater than the chances we were coming back." he said he called his family members beforehand -- not offering details on what he was doing, but knowing that they'd soon find out no matter how the mission ended. he also wrote letters to his young children, only to be delivered if he didn't survive at a later date when, for instance, he wasn't there for their __weddings.__ after the mission started, o'neill described landing outside bin laden's compound on the second of two helicopters, after the first one had __crash-landed.__ he said he was the eighth seal in line as they moved from the __compound's__ first floor to its second. on that floor, six ahead of him split off to take out bin laden's son, clear other rooms and identify potential threats. he was now second in line headed to the third floor, where they expected to find bin laden. opinion: did robert o'neill really kill bin __laden?__ as the group reached the third floor, he said, the seal in front of him dove on top of an __"unknown"__ person -- it turned out to be a woman -- to absorb what they feared could be a blast from a suicide __vest.__ he said he thought "let's get this over with" as he entered the room expecting to be blown up by bin laden. that's when o'neill identified the al qaeda __mastermind.__ "i shot him twice in the head, he fell on the floor," he said. "i shot him one more time, and i killed him." the magnitude of what he'd done didn't register immediately. o'neill first worried about eliminating other potential threats -- moving a woman and child out of the way, and then clearing the room. "it wasn't until the room was cleared and there were more seals in the room that it kind of hit me. i had a moment of __pause,"__ he said. a friend put his hand on __o'neill's__ shoulder.

"he said, __'now__ we go find the __computers.'__ i said, 'ok, i'm __back.'"__ the 90-minute flight back to the u.s. air base in afghanistan was __stressful,__ too, as the seals counted down the time until they exited pakistan's airspace. then, they could __exhale.__ one seal laid next to bin laden's body to measure his height -- part of confirming his identity. the group hadn't brought a tape measure. later, o'neill sat feet from bin laden's body, eating a breakfast sandwich and watching a flat-screen television, while watching president barack obama announce to the world that the united states had killed bin laden.

"while we have made progress in making food safer -- including cutting e. coli __o157-related__ illnesses in half -- we still have work to do. as salmonella rates continue to __stagnate,__ we look forward to __cspi's__ support, and the support of other groups committed to food safety, of our efforts to reduce this dangerous foodborne __pathogen,__ including modernization of the poultry inspection system." in april, the environmental working group published an analysis of existing data on __antibiotic-resistant__ bacteria contained in meat sold in __supermarkets.__ __eighty-one__ percent of ground chicken, 69% of pork __chops,__ 55% of ground beef and 39% of chicken were found to contain the bacteria, the organization reported, citing data from a february food and drug administration report. antibiotic resistance reduces doctors' options to treat you if you become ill. what government tests found in your meat . every year the environmental working group publishes its "dirty __dozen"__ fruits and vegetables. the advocacy group describes it as a consumer __shoppers'__ guide to determine which types of produce pose the highest threat of __pesticides.__ although pesticides are not a cause of foodborne illness, produce can be a source of food poisoning. in 2012, __cantaloupes,__ spinach and spring mix salad and __mangoes__ were linked to __outbreaks.__ improving food safety begins before the products ever reach the consumer, at the slaughterhouse and in the fields, but "being careful in the kitchen is also very important," said dr. robert __tauxe,__ deputy director of the cdc's division of __foodborne,__ waterborne and environmental diseases. so what's a consumer to do? at the store . a cdc study published in 2010 once again highlighted the fact that young children can be exposed to raw meat and poultry products while riding in shopping __carts,__ particularly if they ride in the basket of the cart. researchers suggest that parents keep their child away from these products, which could be leaking juices carrying bacteria, by placing their child in the __cart's__ seat, and not place meat or poultry products in the seat while shopping to avoid contamination. all consumers can benefit from separating their raw meat, poultry and seafood purchases from other food products to prevent __cross-contamination.__ the usda recommends placing these types of foods in plastic bags and also placing these purchases in separate shopping bags at __checkout.__ storage . packaging meat products in __leak-proof__ containers would also help cut __cross-contamination.__ new zealand, for instance, saw a significant reduction in foodborne illness after mandating __leak-proof__ __packaging,__ __tauxe__ said. when you get home, storing raw meats in a plastic bag or container to prevent any juices from dripping on other foods is also important. listeria __monocytogenes,__ another type of __illness-causing__ bacteria, can grow in foods in the __refrigerator,__ according to the cdc. use an appliance thermometer to check the temperature inside the __fridge;__ it should be 40 degrees or lower, and the freezer should be 0 degrees or lower. food preparation . start with clean hands. wash with soap and water for 20 seconds __(sing__ "happy __birthday"__ __twice)__ before and after handling food -- and after other activities, such as changing diapers or using the bathroom. ideally, use separate cutting boards for fruits and vegetables and raw meat to avoid __cross-contamination.__ wash fruits and vegetables under running water. __scrubbing__ __melons__ and cucumbers with a clean brush is __recommended;__ using soap to clean them is not. some home cooks wash their meat under running water before cooking, but, experts say, that can spread contaminated juices in places that may not be visible. use hot, __soapy__ water to clean __utensils__ and cutting boards after preparing __foods;__ use hot, __soapy__ water and paper towels or clean towels to clean work surfaces. proper cooking is essential for meat, poultry and __seafood.__ cooking temperatures have to reach a certain temperature to destroy bacteria such as e. coli and __salmonella;__ a meat thermometer is the only way to be sure those temperatures have been reached. a thermometer should be placed in the __thickest__ part of the meat without touching the bone. ground beef, lamb and poultry should be cooked to 160 degrees __fahrenheit;__ whole __chickens,__ turkeys and poultry parts to 165 __degrees;__ and whole cuts of __meat-like__ __steaks,__ chops and __roasts__ to 145 degrees, followed by three minutes of rest time before carving or eating. storing leftovers . harmful bacteria can start growing at room temperature, so any leftovers should go into the fridge or freezer within two hours of cooking. storage times for the fridge and freezer can vary depending on the food.

(cnn) -- an estimated one percent of adults have active __epilepsy,__ and many of them are getting insufficient treatment, according to a __19-state__ survey released thursday. "this is the first time that we actually have data from multiple states," said __rosemarie__ __kobau,__ lead author of the centers for disease control and prevention study, in a telephone interview. "what we learned is that, among adults with active __epilepsy,__ more than a third of them reported not seeing a specialist for their __epilepsy,__ and that's really unacceptable." a follow-up survey is planned to determine why so many people with seizure disorders said they had not seen a specialist in the past year, __kobau__ said. "this is a highly specialized field," said eric __hargis,__ the president and ceo of the epilepsy foundation, which collaborated with the authors of the study. "it's not possible to get state-of-the-art care" for the disorder from primary care doctors. one in six __(16.1__ percent) adults with active epilepsy with recent seizures said they were not taking their medication and two-thirds __(65.1__ percent) said they had had more than one seizure during the prior month. more than a fifth __(20.4__ percent) said cost was a barrier to seeking care from their doctor. access to high-quality care is key to quality of life, __kobau__ said. people with __recurrent__ seizures face substantial __impairments__ in their daily __activities;__ many are not allowed to drive and, as a result, depend on public transportation. in some areas, particularly rural ones, that can present a barrier to full participation in life, she said. that's not all. in addition to carrying stigma, people with epilepsy were more likely to live in households with the lowest annual incomes and to report being unemployed and unable to work. according to the 2005 findings, __1.65__ percent of the population said they had been told by a doctor that they had epilepsy or a seizure disorder, the report said. half of that group __(0.84__ percent) said they had active epilepsy -- defined as having had one or more seizures during the prior three months or currently taking medication. if the findings translate to the general population, that means a stadium filled with 60,000 people would contain 480 people with active __epilepsy,__ __kobau__ noted, adding, __"epilepsy__ is not __rare."__ but that view was disputed by dr. james king, a family physician in __selmer,__ tennessee, and president of the american association of family physicians. "there are patients that can be managed fairly simply with seizure disorder," he said in a telephone interview. "in my own personal practice, i'd say that i can manage at least half, if not more, of the patients that have seizure __disorder."__ many of the others are able to get by with just a one-time visit to a __neurologist,__ said king, whose practice is 50 miles from the nearest __neurologist,__ and 100 miles from the nearest neurologist who accepts medicaid, the government program for the poor. "there's only a handful of patients that are managed in my area by the __neurologist."__ he said financial barriers -- from insurance to the cost of __anti-seizure__ medication -- are a bigger problem. "if you can't afford to buy it -- which is what i run into with a lot of the seizure medicine -- it doesn't really matter" if patients see a neurologist or a family physician, he said. many patients, forced to choose between paying their light bill or taking their __anti-seizure__ medication, choose the __former,__ king said. epilepsy is a condition in which the normal activity of the brain __malfunctions,__ causing __recurrent__ seizures -- electrical storms in the brain -- that can be characterized by a range of symptoms, including sudden change in awareness, movement or sensation. each year, about 200,000 people in the united states are diagnosed with the disease, as was supreme court chief justice john roberts after he suffered a seizure last year at his maine vacation home. "many people with epilepsy do lead normal, productive lives despite the hardship of having this disorder," __kobau__ said. the study, conducted by the federal government and published in the cdc's __morbidity__ and mortality weekly report, estimates that 2.7 million people in the united states have __epilepsy,__ and that it costs some __$15.5__ billion in medical care and lost or reduced earnings or productivity each year. __hargis__ said the incidence of the disorder is expected to climb among veterans returning from iraq or afghanistan, where head injuries are common. "when you have a head injury, it's common for epilepsy to develop after a gestational period -- it could be a couple of months or it could be years," he said. and the aging population is also expected to boost the incidence of __epilepsy.__ conditions of aging, such as stroke and alzheimer's disease, are also associated with a higher incidence of __epilepsy.__ the study was based on data from more than 120,000 adults in the behavioral risk factor surveillance system.

"the chinese way is different from the western way, because our government gives you a lot of help and just asks back a little __bit...__ if someone helps you and you never give back, i'd think they didn't want to be friends with me," she explained. li is hopeful that other chinese players will follow in her __footsteps,__ although it may be a long wait for a chinese man to emulate her grand slam tournament performances. "i believe that in five year for sure, there will be a chinese guy coming into the top 50. they are working so hard. in winter training i was with the national team, so i saw a lot of good players among juniors -- young girls and boys. so i was feeling 'yeah, after three years maybe china will be like russia or __america'__ -- they have many people coming to play in __tournaments,"__ she said.

istanbul (cnn) -- turkish warplanes carried out a second night of airstrikes against suspected kurdish rebel targets in northern iraq, as deadly clashes erupted within turkey between security forces and guerrilla fighters. meanwhile, a spokesman for the kurdistan regional government in northern iraq expressed concern friday about the turkish cross border raids. in an interview with cnn, __kawa__ mahmoud called on turkey to resolve its __long-simmering__ conflict with kurdish separatist through diplomacy, not violence. "we always emphasize that shelling (the) iraqi border is inconsistent with international conventions and good __neighborly__ relations, and we consider it as intervention and disregard for the sovereignty of the kurdish and iraqi territory," mahmoud said, adding "the bombings directly affect the infrastructure of the region of __(iraqi)__ __kurdistan."__ in a news release friday, the turkish military said warplanes and artillery pounded more than 100 targets in rugged mountains of northern iraq where fighters of the kurdistan workers party __(pkk)__ have long been active. the turkish armed forces periodically target what ankara calls pkk "safe __havens"__ and __"attack__ __bases"__ in northern iraq. for more than a decade, these remote border regions have been beyond the authority of the iraqi central government as well as of the semi-autonomous kurdish administration that governs the northern part of the country. in the meantime, turkish officials told cnn two more turkish soldiers were killed in clashes in a remote region of __south-eastern__ __siirt__ province thursday night. an official from the __siirt__ governor's office, speaking on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the media, said suspected rebel fighters carried out two __night-time__ attacks on local __gendarme__ stations and government buildings using __"rocket__ launchers and long-range weapons." the official said two turkish soldiers were killed and four wounded in the fighting. he said three rebels including a female fighter were also killed in the clashes. dozens of turkish soldiers have been killed over the last month, in a clear escalation of the conflict that has raged intermittently between kurdish separatists and the turkish state since 1984. more than 30,000 people have been killed in the conflict, many of them ethnic kurds. the kurds are turkey's largest ethnic minority. for decades, ankara imposed oppressive policies, which banned kurdish names and language and sometimes referred to the community as __"mountain__ __turks."__ the government of prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has attempted to improve relations with turkey's kurds in recent years by launching a kurdish channel on state television and acknowledging __"mistakes__ were __made"__ in the way ankara treated the minorities. but tensions have escalated between erdogan's government and the main kurdish nationalist political party in recent months. after winning a larger number of seats in june parliamentary elections, the main kurdish peace and democracy party __(bdp)__ boycotted the swearing-in ceremony for new lawmakers. kurdish lawmakers are protesting a decision by turkey's electoral board, which disqualified a prominent kurdish candidate from participating in the june election. politician __hatip__ __dicle__ was barred from running due to a __20-month__ prison sentence he received for "making propaganda for a terrorist organization," a turkish reference to the __pkk.__ meanwhile, riots involving kurdish youths have periodically erupted in recent months in istanbul and other turkish cities.

if you're tired of nagging your kids (or another member of your __household)__ to brush their teeth, you have a new ally. a french company has introduced what they're calling the world's first connected electric __toothbrush,__ which __syncs__ __wirelessly__ with a smartphone to track brushing habits, announce whether you, or your kids, have brushed thoroughly enough and reward you for good oral __hygiene.__ for extra motivation, or __shaming,__ the brush can share information with your social network or even your __dentist.__ it's called the __kolibree__ __toothbrush,__ and it was unveiled this week at the international consumer electronics show in las vegas, where some attendees asked if they could test prototypes on their __pearly__ whites right there (for sanitary reasons, the answer was __no).__ the device will cost from $99 to __$200,__ depending on the model, and will be available for __pre-order__ this summer through kickstarter or another crowdfunding site. "it works just like a regular __toothbrush,"__ said __kolibree__ spokesperson renee __blodgett__ in a phone interview. "the only difference is that all the data is stored on your phone so you can see how you're __brushing."__ users download a mobile app and connect via __bluetooth,__ and the __kolibree__ documents every brushing via three sensors that record 1) how long you brush, 2) whether you brush all four __quadrants__ of your mouth, and 3) whether you brush up and down __(good)__ instead of just side to side __(bad).__ the data automatically __syncs__ to your android phone or iphone, telling you whether you brushed long enough and reached all the crucial areas of your teeth and __gums.__ the __kolibree__ app charts your progress and scores your brushing technique to encourage you, or your kids, to improve brushing habits. in this way, the device turns a mundane daily activity into a game, which its makers hope will engage people -- especially kids -- and encourage them to brush longer and more often. "you create this incentive around __brushing,"__ __blodgett__ said. the brushing data also will be available via an __api__ to let third-party game designers develop new apps for the __kolibree__ system. the __kolibree__ __toothbrush__ was invented by thomas __serval,__ a french engineer and a leader in that country's tech industry. he was inspired to design it after __suspecting__ that his children were lying to him about whether they had brushed their teeth. it's not the first "smart" __toothbrush__ on the market, __however:__ the __manual,__ $25 beam brush went on sale about a year ago. the beam also connects to phones via bluetooth and records brushing time, although unlike the __kolibree__ it cannot track the __brush's__ movements in the mouth.
